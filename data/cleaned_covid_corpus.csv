PMC1764036,2007-01-03,The Waiting Time for Inter-Country Spread of Pandemic Influenza," The time delay between the start of an influenza pandemic and its subsequent initiation in other countries is highly relevant to preparedness planning. We quantify the distribution of this random time in terms of the separate components of this delay, and assess how the delay may be extended by non-pharmaceutical interventions. METHODS AND FINDINGS The model constructed for this time delay accounts for (i) epidemic growth in the source region, (ii) the delay until an infected individual from the source region seeks to travel to an at-risk country, (iii) the chance that infected travelers are detected by screening at exit and entry borders, (iv) the possibility of in-flight transmission, (v) the chance that an infected arrival might not initiate an epidemic, and (vi) the delay until infection in the at-risk country gathers momentum. Efforts that reduce the disease reproduction number in the source region below two and severe travel restrictions are most effective for delaying a local epidemic, and under favourable circumstances, could add several months to the delay. On the other hand, the model predicts that border screening for symptomatic infection, wearing a protective mask during travel, promoting early presentation of cases arising among arriving passengers and moderate reduction in travel volumes increase the delay only by a matter of days or weeks. Elevated in-flight transmission reduces the delay only minimally. CONCLUSIONS The delay until an epidemic of pandemic strain influenza is imported into an at-risk country is largely determined by the course of the epidemic in the source region and the number of travelers attempting to enter the at-risk country, and is little affected by non-pharmaceutical interventions targeting these travelers. Short of preventing international travel altogether, eradicating a nascent pandemic in the source region appears to be the only reliable method of preventing country-to-country spread of a pandemic strain of influenza.","The emergence of a pandemic strain of influenza is considered inevitable . Provided the emerged strain is not too virulent, it may be possible to eliminate a nascent influenza pandemic in the source region via various combinations of targeted antiviral prophylaxis, pre-vaccination, social distancing and quarantine , . If early elimination in the source region is not achieved, then any delay in a local epidemic that a country can effect will be highly valued. To this end, countries may consider introducing non-pharmaceutical interventions such as border screening, promoting early presentation of cases among arriving passengers, requiring the use of personal protective equipment during travels (e.g. the wearing of masks), and reducing traveler numbers. While the case for believing that measures such as these can not stop the importation of an epidemic from overseas has been argued strongly, whether it be SARS or influenza –, the extent to which such interventions delay a local epidemic is currently not well quantified, and hence of considerable interest. In this paper we demonstrate how the delay to importation of an epidemic of pandemic strain influenza may be quantified in terms of the growing infection incidence in the source region, traveler volumes, border screening measures, travel duration, in-flight transmission and the delay until an infected arrival initiates a chain of transmission that gathers momentum. We also investigate how the delay is affected by the reproduction number of the emerged strain, early presentation of cases among arriving passengers, and reducing traveler numbers. As noted in previous simulation modeling , many aspects of this delay have a significant chance component, making the delay a random variable. Therefore, the way to quantify the delay is to specify its probability distribution, which we call the delay-distribution."
PMC1950082,2007-08-22,Estimating Individual and Household Reproduction Numbers in an Emerging Epidemic,"Reproduction numbers, defined as averages of the number of people infected by a typical case, play a central role in tracking infectious disease outbreaks. The aim of this paper is to develop methods for estimating reproduction numbers which are simple enough that they could be applied with limited data or in real time during an outbreak. I present a new estimator for the individual reproduction number, which describes the state of the epidemic at a point in time rather than tracking individuals over time, and discuss some potential benefits. Then, to capture more of the detail that micro-simulations have shown is important in outbreak dynamics, I analyse a model of transmission within and between households, and develop a method to estimate the household reproduction number, defined as the number of households infected by each infected household. This method is validated by numerical simulations of the spread of influenza and measles using historical data, and estimates are obtained for would-be emerging epidemics of these viruses. I argue that the household reproduction number is useful in assessing the impact of measures that target the household for isolation, quarantine, vaccination or prophylactic treatment, and measures such as social distancing and school or workplace closures which limit between-household transmission, all of which play a key role in current thinking on future infectious disease mitigation.","The household is a fundamental unit of transmission for many directly transmitted infections. In addition, the household provides a “laboratory” within which key measures of transmission such as infectiousness, generation time and the effect of immunity or vaccination can be studied . In recent years considerable effort has gone into understanding the dynamics of transmission within populations organised into households using mathematical models , , , , . Most effort has gone into analysing the asymptotic behaviour of these models, elucidating the threshold levels of transmission required for infection to be self-sustaining, calculating final epidemic sizes, or predicting the impact of generalised or targeted interventions designed to reduce or eliminate transmission. In parallel, methods have been derived to estimate the parameters which govern transmission within the household from detailed case reports , , , . However, scant effort appears to have been paid to how to apply household structured models to the analysis of epidemics, either retrospectively or in real time. Concurrently, mathematical models have played an ever greater role in interpreting and responding to emerging pathogens. These models have typically been either of the “simple but tractable” variety which ignore or average over demographic structure and social mixing patterns ,  or the “complex computer simulation” variety that capture many details of demographic structure and dynamics, but of whom the behaviour can only be determined by intensive numerical analysis , , . The aim of this study is to develop methods of a perhaps “slightly less simple but still tractable” variety that capture some of the detail that micro-simulations have shown is important, but which can be rapidly applied (say on a daily basis) in an emerging outbreak situation, to inform policy. More specifically, the aim is to arrive at a method to estimate the key transmission and control parameters for a model of transmission within and between households from as few detailed observations as are likely to be gathered in the heat of a major outbreak."

The EISS dataset was used to characterise important epidemiological features of influenza activity in Europe during eight winters (1999–2007). The following questions were addressed 1) are the sentinel clinical reports a good measure of influenza activity? 2) how long is a typical influenza season in Europe? 3) is there a west-east and/or south-north course of peak activity ('spread') of influenza in Europe? METHODS Influenza activity was measured by collecting data from sentinel general practitioners (GPs) and reports by national reference laboratories. The sentinel reports were first evaluated by comparing them to the laboratory reports and were then used to assess the timing and spread of influenza activity across Europe during eight seasons. RESULTS We found a good match between the clinical sentinel data and laboratory reports of influenza collected by sentinel physicians (overall match of 72% for +/- 1 week difference). We also found a moderate to good match between the clinical sentinel data and laboratory reports of influenza from non-sentinel sources (overall match of 60% for +/- 1 week). There were no statistically significant differences between countries using ILI (influenza-like illness) or ARI (acute respiratory disease) as case definition. When looking at the peak-weeks of clinical activity, the average length of an influenza season in Europe was 15.6 weeks (median 15 weeks; range 12–19 weeks). Plotting the peak weeks of clinical influenza activity reported by sentinel GPs against the longitude or latitude of each country indicated that there was a west-east spread of peak activity (spread) of influenza across Europe in four winters (2001–2002, 2002–2003, 2003–2004 and 2004–2005) and a south-north spread in three winters (2001–2002, 2004–2005 and 2006–2007). CONCLUSION We found that 1) the clinical data reported by sentinel physicians is a valid indicator of influenza activity; 2) the length of influenza activity across the whole of Europe was surprisingly long, ranging from 12–19 weeks; 3) in 4 out of the 8 seasons, there was a west-east spread of influenza, in 3 seasons a south-north spread; not associated with type of dominant virus in those seasons.","Influenza has an important impact on societies each season. Surveillance data not only provide valuable information on the burden of disease in the population [1,2], but also enables an assessment of whether the vaccine is a good match with the circulating virus [3,4]. Surveillance may help to plan and allocate health care resources and is important for pandemic preparedness . In addition, the surveillance infrastructure can be used to monitor new emerging respiratory diseases, like SARS or avian influenza in humans . Countries in Europe have shared detailed clinical and virological data via the European Influenza Surveillance Scheme (EISS) since 1996 . This collaborative project is partially funded by the European Commission through the European Centre of Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) and currently includes 30 countries. The scheme covers a total population of about 450 million inhabitants and an area of roughly 12 million square kilometres. EISS collects two types of data on influenza activity each season 1) clinical and virological data collected by sentinel GPs and 2) virological data from non-sentinel sources. In the present study the EISS dataset was used to characterise important epidemiological features of influenza activity in Europe during eight winters (1999–2007). In recent seasons there have been indications that influenza activity first appeared in the west of Europe and then moved east across Europe. As an example, during the 2003–2004 season, activity began in Ireland, the United Kingdom, Portugal and Spain in early August and reached Poland in February 2004 . These observations led us to assess three related questions"
PMC2275240,2008-02-26,Epigrass: a tool to study disease spread in complex networks," The construction of complex spatial simulation models such as those used in network epidemiology, is a daunting task due to the large amount of data involved in their parameterization. Such data, which frequently resides on large geo-referenced databases, has to be processed and assigned to the various components of the model. All this just to construct the model, then it still has to be simulated and analyzed under different epidemiological scenarios. This workflow can only be achieved efficiently by computational tools that can automate most, if not all, these time-consuming tasks. In this paper, we present a simulation software, Epigrass, aimed to help designing and simulating network-epidemic models with any kind of node behavior. RESULTS A Network epidemiological model representing the spread of a directly transmitted disease through a bus-transportation network connecting mid-size cities in Brazil. Results show that the topological context of the starting point of the epidemic is of great importance from both control and preventive perspectives. CONCLUSION Epigrass is shown to facilitate greatly the construction, simulation and analysis of complex network models. The output of model results in standard GIS file formats facilitate the post-processing and analysis of results by means of sophisticated GIS software.","Epigrass is a platform for network epidemiological simulation and analysis. It enables researchers to perform comprehensive spatio-temporal simulations incorporating epidemiological data and models for disease transmission and control in order to create complex scenario analyses. Epigrass is designed towards facilitating the construction and simulation of large scale metapopulational models. Each component population of such a metapopulational model is assumed to be connected through a contact network which determines migration flows between populations. This connectivity model can be easily adapted to represent any type of adjacency structure. Epigrass is entirely written in the Python language, which contributes greatly to the flexibility of the whole system due to the dynamical nature of the language. The geo-referenced networks over which epidemiological processes take place can be very straightforwardly represented in a object-oriented framework. Consequently, the nodes and edges of the geographical networks are objects with their own attributes and methods (figure 1)."
PMC2366072,2008-05-14,Real Time Bayesian Estimation of the Epidemic Potential of Emerging Infectious Diseases," Fast changes in human demographics worldwide, coupled with increased mobility, and modified land uses make the threat of emerging infectious diseases increasingly important. Currently there is worldwide alert for H5N1 avian influenza becoming as transmissible in humans as seasonal influenza, and potentially causing a pandemic of unprecedented proportions. Here we show how epidemiological surveillance data for emerging infectious diseases can be interpreted in real time to assess changes in transmissibility with quantified uncertainty, and to perform running time predictions of new cases and guide logistics allocations. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS We develop an extension of standard epidemiological models, appropriate for emerging infectious diseases, that describes the probabilistic progression of case numbers due to the concurrent effects of (incipient) human transmission and multiple introductions from a reservoir. The model is cast in terms of surveillance observables and immediately suggests a simple graphical estimation procedure for the effective reproductive number R (mean number of cases generated by an infectious individual) of standard epidemics. For emerging infectious diseases, which typically show large relative case number fluctuations over time, we develop a Bayesian scheme for real time estimation of the probability distribution of the effective reproduction number and show how to use such inferences to formulate significance tests on future epidemiological observations. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE Violations of these significance tests define statistical anomalies that may signal changes in the epidemiology of emerging diseases and should trigger further field investigation. We apply the methodology to case data from World Health Organization reports to place bounds on the current transmissibility of H5N1 influenza in humans and establish a statistical basis for monitoring its evolution in real time.","A pandemic of H5N1 influenza in birds is presently unfolding, with over 50 countries around the world affected, resulting in hundreds of millions of dead animals through infection or culling –. This emergency and the associated risk of a devastating new human pandemic – stress the need for new approaches targeted specifically at detecting and monitoring the evolution of emerging infectious diseases –. Assessing the risk of emergence of a human epidemic at the genetic level requires accounting for rare stochastic events, associated with genetic mutation and recombination, over vast pathogen and host populations , , . This makes prediction of pathogenic evolution at the molecular level typically still very difficult. Consequently, the first indications of disease emergence are usually observed as infected cases in human and animal populations. Thus, for early assessments of the epidemic potential of a new outbreak, it is essential to assign quantitative meaning to existing epidemiological surveillance data in real time, with quantified uncertainty, and to use this knowledge to enable primary prevention strategies targeted at reducing chances of pathogenic evolution. The quantity that measures the epidemic potential of a pathogen is the basic reproduction number R
0
, . R
0 is defined as the average number of new infections created by an infectious individual in an entirely susceptible population. For established human pathogens, leading to standard epidemics, R
0>1, as is the case of seasonal or pandemic influenza –. In practice, epidemiological data typically permit only the estimation of the effective reproduction number R, which may differ from R
0 due to acquired immunity and other factors. For an emerging infectious disease, when transmission is only incipient  and the pathogen is adapting to the population, it becomes crucial to monitor quantitative changes of the effective reproduction number over time. Thus, the detection and tracking of an emerging disease can be formalized in terms of monitoring R, as it evolves and approaches the critical threshold R→1. This is likely the current state of H5N1 avian influenza in humans, where complete absence of human to human transmission would imply R = 0, but likely R is very small, as a few cases of possible human contagion suggest –."
PMC2648660,2009-01-04,Smallpox and Season: Reanalysis of Historical Data,"Seasonal variation in smallpox transmission is one of the most pressing ecological questions and is relevant to bioterrorism preparedness. The present study reanalyzed 7 historical datasets which recorded monthly cases or deaths. In addition to time series analyses of reported data, an estimation and spectral analysis of the effective reproduction number at calendar time t, R(t), were made. Meteorological variables were extracted from a report in India from 1890–1921 and compared with smallpox mortality as well as R(t). Annual cycles of smallpox transmission were clearly shown not only in monthly reports but also in the estimates of R(t). Even short-term epidemic data clearly exhibited an annual peak every January. Both mortality and R(t) revealed significant negative association (P < .01) and correlation (P < .01), respectively, with humidity. These findings suggest that smallpox transmission greatly varies with season and is most likely enhanced by dry weather.","Smallpox is the only disease to have been eradicated worldwide . Despite
the success story of vaccination and other public health interventions, the
number of susceptible individuals has grown to date following cessation of
routine vaccination, and the threat of bioterrorist attack has led to debates
on countermeasures in such an event . Various mathematical studies have been
conducted as part of a preparedness program, including large-scale simulation of
a bioterrorist attack and the public health countermeasures against it [3–6]. Theoretical
studies on the spread of smallpox include not only simulations but also
quantitative analysis of historical data [7–10]. A
statistical modeling study suggests that a small outbreak could be contained only
implementing contact tracing and isolation . Moreover, those who underwent
vaccination in the past are believed to be still protected against severe and
fatal manifestations of smallpox even today [7, 12]. 
Studies on smallpox control have progressed in parallel with the
development of epidemiological and statistical methods, and because of the eradication
before maturation of biostatistics, many questions have remained in regards to
the details of the epidemiology. Seasonal variation in smallpox transmission is
one of the most pressing ecological questions playing a key role in determining
the transmission dynamics, should a future outbreak occur following the deliberate release [1, 4]. For example, clarification of the seasonal
preference of variola virus is crucial for identifying and forecasting the
disease risk using ecological data . Although seasonal occurrence of
smallpox was documented early on among directly transmitted infectious diseases
[14, 15], and whereas the disease is believed to be one of the “winter diseases”
in industrialized countries, even the presence of seasonality has not been investigated
in detail."
PMC2653495,2009-01-22,Antiviral resistance during pandemic influenza: implications for stockpiling and drug use," The anticipated extent of antiviral use during an influenza pandemic can have adverse consequences for the development of drug resistance and rationing of limited stockpiles. The strategic use of drugs is therefore a major public health concern in planning for effective pandemic responses. METHODS We employed a mathematical model that includes both sensitive and resistant strains of a virus with pandemic potential, and applies antiviral drugs for treatment of clinical infections. Using estimated parameters in the published literature, the model was simulated for various sizes of stockpiles to evaluate the outcome of different antiviral strategies. RESULTS We demonstrated that the emergence of highly transmissible resistant strains has no significant impact on the use of available stockpiles if treatment is maintained at low levels or the reproduction number of the sensitive strain is sufficiently high. However, moderate to high treatment levels can result in a more rapid depletion of stockpiles, leading to run-out, by promoting wide-spread drug resistance. We applied an antiviral strategy that delays the onset of aggressive treatment for a certain amount of time after the onset of the outbreak. Our results show that if high treatment levels are enforced too early during the outbreak, a second wave of infections can potentially occur with a substantially larger magnitude. However, a timely implementation of wide-scale treatment can prevent resistance spread in the population, and minimize the final size of the pandemic. CONCLUSION Our results reveal that conservative treatment levels during the early stages of the outbreak, followed by a timely increase in the scale of drug-use, will offer an effective strategy to manage drug resistance in the population and avoid run-out. For a 1918-like strain, the findings suggest that pandemic plans should consider stockpiling antiviral drugs to cover at least 20% of the population.","Future outbreaks of emerging infectious pathogens are virtually certain to occur, and pandemic influenza is one that seemingly poses a significant threat to human populations. While the characteristics of the next pandemic strain remain unknown, the virulence of the currently circulating avian influenza A virus H5N1 is of great concern [1,2]. Given uncertainties regarding the timing, origin, and virulence of future pandemic strains, as well as the possibility of an unprecedented spread of the deadly H5N1 virus in humans, planning strategies for an effective response has become the top priority of global public health efforts [3-7]. Pandemic preparedness measures encompass disease surveillance, case identification and treatment, prevention of community-wide spread of disease, maintenance of essential services, and research and evaluation . Specific approaches to influenza infection control include the use of pharmaceutical products (such as vaccines and antiviral drugs), and non-pharmaceutical measures (such as personal protective equipment and social distancing). Although vaccination remains the most effective strategy for reducing the risk of infection and subsequent complications , an effective vaccine may not be available for several months following the declaration of a pandemic. This highlights the importance of antiviral drugs as the primary tool for prevention and treatment of infection , especially in light of the insufficient impact that non-pharmaceutical measures may have on disease mitigation ."
PMC2660689,2009-01-03,Enhanced Hygiene Measures and Norovirus Transmission during an Outbreak,"Control of norovirus outbreaks relies on enhanced hygiene measures, such as handwashing, surface cleaning, using disposable paper towels, and using separate toilets for sick and well persons. However, little is known about their effectiveness in limiting further spread of norovirus infections. We analyzed norovirus outbreaks in 7 camps at an international scouting jamboree in the Netherlands during 2004. Implementation of hygiene measures coincided with an 84.8% (95% predictive interval 81.2%–86.6%) reduction in reproduction number. This reduction was unexpectedly large but still below the reduction needed to contain a norovirus outbreak. Even more stringent control measures are required to break the chain of transmission of norovirus.","An outbreak of norovirus infection occurred at an international scout jamboree in the Netherlands during the summer of 2004 . Approximately 4,500 persons from 32 countries attended this event. At the start of the scout jamboree on July 26, 2004, two participants became ill with symptoms of gastroenteritis. The outbreak affected at least 326 persons with typical, generally mild symptoms of gastroenteritis (case-patients). Most ill persons experienced vomiting  and/or diarrhea . Ninety-two ill persons visited a local first aid tent; another 54 were admitted to a local hospital for rehydration. The jamboree was held on a large site, ≈600 m × 1,000 m. Jamboree participants were divided into 7 camps according to age 3 camps each for participants 11–14 and 15–17 years of age and 1 camp for staff >18 years of age. The 7 camps were situated around a central field for joint activities; most activities were organized within the camps. The camps were labeled A–G, according to the day the first participants became sick. For 296 (91%) of 326 case-patients, the camp label was known (Figure 1, Table)."
PMC2684067,2009-05-13,Health workers' views on quality of prevention of mother-to-child transmission and postnatal care for HIV-infected women and their children," Prevention of mother-to-child transmission has been considered as not a simple intervention but a comprehensive set of interventions requiring capable health workers. Viet Nam's extensive health care system reaches the village level, but still HIV-infected mothers and children have received inadequate health care services for prevention of mother-to-child transmission. We report here the health workers' perceptions on factors that lead to their failure to give good quality prevention of mother-to-child transmission services. METHODS Semistructured interviews with 53 health workers and unstructured observations in nine health facilities in Hanoi were conducted. Selection of respondents was based on their function, position and experience in the development or implementation of prevention of mother-to-child transmission policies/programmes. RESULTS Factors that lead to health workers' failure to give good quality services for prevention of mother-to-child transmission include their own fear of HIV infection; lack of knowledge on HIV and counselling skills; or high workloads and lack of staff; unavailability of HIV testing at commune level; shortage of antiretroviral drugs; and lack of operational guidelines. A negative attitude during counselling and provision of care, treating in a separate area and avoidance of providing service at all were seen by health workers as the result of fear of being infected, as well as distrust towards almost all HIV-infected patients because of the prevailing association with antisocial behaviours. Additionally, the fragmentation of the health care system into specialized vertical pillars, including a vertical programme for HIV/AIDS, is a major obstacle to providing a continuum of care. CONCLUSION Many hospital staff were not being able to provide good care or were even unwilling to provide appropriate care for HIV-positive pregnant women The study suggests that the quality of prevention of mother-to-child transmission service could be enhanced by improving communication and other skills of health workers, providing them with greater support and enhancing their motivation. Reduction of workload would also be important. Development of a practical strategy is needed to strengthen and adapt the referral system to meet the needs of patients.","Prevention of mother-to-child transmission (PMTCT) has been considered a simple intervention just giving medication to prevent viral transmission from mother to child. Now, though, PMTCT is recognized as a comprehensive set of interventions requiring capable health workers. It starts with testing pregnant women for HIV, preferably during their first antenatal visit. When giving the test result, health care workers should provide good counselling, including information about PMTCT options. The health system should ensure that HIV-positive women receive the PMTCT services that they choose and should provide postnatal care. All along the timeline from finding out their serostatus to getting treatment for HIV-related problems, women and their children should be followed closely. The need for comprehensive and long-term care for HIV-infected women has become a challenge for health systems, particularly where lack of coordination among different facilities is common [1,2]."
PMC2770169,2009-10-16,Using Dynamic Stochastic Modelling to Estimate Population Risk Factors in Infectious Disease: The Example of FIV in 15 Cat Populations," In natural cat populations, Feline Immunodeficiency Virus (FIV) is transmitted through bites between individuals. Factors such as the density of cats within the population or the sex-ratio can have potentially strong effects on the frequency of fight between individuals and hence appear as important population risk factors for FIV. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS To study such population risk factors, we present data on FIV prevalence in 15 cat populations in northeastern France. We investigate five key social factors of cat populations; the density of cats, the sex-ratio, the number of males and the mean age of males and females within the population. We overcome the problem of dependence in the infective status data using sexually-structured dynamic stochastic models. Only the age of males and females had an effect (p = 0.043 and p = 0.02, respectively) on the male-to-female transmission rate. Due to multiple tests, it is even likely that these effects are, in reality, not significant. Finally we show that, in our study area, the data can be explained by a very simple model that does not invoke any risk factor. CONCLUSION Our conclusion is that, in host-parasite systems in general, fluctuations due to stochasticity in the transmission process are naturally very large and may alone explain a larger part of the variability in observed disease prevalence between populations than previously expected. Finally, we determined confidence intervals for the simple model parameters that can be used to further aid in management of the disease.","Feline Immunodeficiency Virus (FIV) infects numerous feline species worldwide . This Lentivirus from Retroviridae family is closely related to Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) and Simian Immunodeficiency Virus (SIV) . This is a virus of major importance because it is lethal to the domestic cat (Felis silvestris catus) and can affect several other cat species, most of which are threatened or endangered e.g., the European wildcat F. s. silvestris in Europe –. There is thus a need to better understand the risk factors affecting the spread and patterns of persistence of FIV in natural populations of domestic cats. In natural domestic cat populations, FIV is mainly transmitted through bites arising from aggressive or sexual contacts , –. As a consequence, the spread of FIV in domestic cat populations is highly influenced by the mating system; a higher FIV prevalence is observed in aggressive and polygynous cat populations that involve more fights and bites than in much less aggressive and promiscuous urban ones , , where FIV can be absent ."
PMC2813231,2009-12-24,Calculating the potential for within-flight transmission of influenza A (H1N1)," Clearly air travel, by transporting infectious individuals from one geographic location to another, significantly affects the rate of spread of influenza A (H1N1). However, the possibility of within-flight transmission of H1N1 has not been evaluated; although it is known that smallpox, measles, tuberculosis, SARS and seasonal influenza can be transmitted during commercial flights. Here we present the first quantitative risk assessment to assess the potential for within-flight transmission of H1N1. METHODS We model airborne transmission of infectious viral particles of H1N1 within a Boeing 747 using methodology from the field of quantitative microbial risk assessment. RESULTS The risk of catching H1N1 will essentially be confined to passengers travelling in the same cabin as the source case. Not surprisingly, we find that the longer the flight the greater the number of infections that can be expected. We calculate that H1N1, even during long flights, poses a low to moderate within-flight transmission risk if the source case travels First Class. Specifically, 0-1 infections could occur during a 5 hour flight, 1-3 during an 11 hour flight and 2-5 during a 17 hour flight. However, within-flight transmission could be significant, particularly during long flights, if the source case travels in Economy Class. Specifically, two to five infections could occur during a 5 hour flight, 5-10 during an 11 hour flight and 7-17 during a 17 hour flight. If the aircraft is only partially loaded, under certain conditions more infections could occur in First Class than in Economy Class. During a 17 hour flight, a greater number of infections would occur in First Class than in Economy if the First Class Cabin is fully occupied, but Economy class is less than 30% full. CONCLUSIONS Our results provide insights into the potential utility of air travel restrictions on controlling influenza pandemics in the winter of 2009/2010. They show travel by one infectious individual, rather than causing a single outbreak of H1N1, could cause several simultaneous outbreaks. These results imply that, during a pandemic, quarantining passengers who travel in Economy on long-haul flights could potentially be an important control strategy. Notably, our results show that quarantining passengers who travel First Class would be unlikely to be an effective control strategy.","Clearly air travel, by transporting infectious individuals from the epicentre in Mexico to other geographic locations, significantly affected the rate of spread of influenza A (H1N1). However, the possibility of within-flight transmission of H1N1 has not been evaluated, although it is known that smallpox, measles, tuberculosis, SARS and seasonal influenza can be transmitted during commercial flights . These pathogens can be transmitted both by direct contact with large respiratory droplets and by airborne transmission of small, aerosolized droplets [2-4]. Several recent empirical studies have attempted to determine which mode of transmission is the most important for influenza. Fabian et al.  conducted studies of seasonal strains to measure the concentration of influenza RNA viral particles exhaled by infected patients. In their study, infected patients exhaled into an Exhalair, a device that collects and counts viral particles in exhaled breath, and the concentration of RNA viral copies was measured in Teflon filters. It was found that 33% of infected humans exhaled droplets containing influenza. Lowen et al.  have experimentally determined that influenza can be transmitted amongst guinea pigs by droplet and/or aerosol spread. In these experiments the guinea pigs were inoculated intranasally and viral samples were collected from nasal washes of their upper and lower respiratory tracts. Viral growth was determined to occur in their lungs and nasal passages, establishing the guinea pig as a model host for droplet infection. Lowen et al.  also found airborne and droplet transmission could occur between animals by conducting experiments in which they placed infected and non-infected guinea pigs in the same cage, adjacent cages and separated cages at least 90 cm apart . A similar and more recent experimental study using ferrets has shown that H1N1 can be transmitted by aerosolized droplets. Although several studies have shown that H1N1 appears to have similar infectivity as seasonal strains the importance of airborne transmission of H1N1 in humans has not yet been definitively established [4-6]. However, it should be noted that airborne transmission of seasonal strains of influenza during a flight, particularly if ventilation is poor, can be significant. As an extreme example, one individual infected with a strain of influenza A managed to infect 72% of passengers during a 3 hour flight on a plane without ventilation . By assuming that H1N1 has a similar infectivity to that of seasonal strains, we calculated the expected number of H1N1 infections that one source case could cause during an international flight. Typically, the number of infected individuals that can be expected during a large scale outbreak or epidemic is determined by calculating the basic reproduction number (R0) . R0 is defined as the average number of secondary infections caused by one infectious individual in a population of susceptible individuals during the time in which they are infectious. Therefore, R0 is a useful measure for predicting the number of infections that could be expected to occur during a large-scale outbreak or an epidemic. However, R0 is not a useful measure for predicting the number of infections that one infectious individual could cause over a few hours in a confined space. In this case, the number of secondary infections is best predicted using methods from the field of quantitative microbial risk assessment. These are the methods that we have used in our analysis. Specifically, we have used the classic Wells-Riley equation  to estimate the number of passengers that could become infected with H1N1 during a commercial flight, assuming one infectious case is on board. The Wells-Riley equation was developed over 30 years ago  and is now the standard methodology for predicting (for infectious pathogens that have airborne transmission) the size of outbreaks within buildings and other enclosed environments."

The present study corrects the concept of the actual reproduction number, offering a simple framework for estimating R without assuming exponential growth of cases. The proposed method is applied to the HIV epidemic in European countries, yielding R values ranging from 3.60 to 3.74, consistent with those based on the Euler-Lotka equation. The method also permits calculating the expected value of R using a spreadsheet.","The basic reproduction number, R0, of an infectious disease is the average number of secondary cases generated by a single primary case in a fully susceptible population . R0 is the most widely used epidemiological measurement of the transmission potential in a given population. Statistical estimation of R0 has been performed for various infectious diseases [2,3], aiming towards understanding the dynamics of transmission and evolution, and designing effective public health intervention strategies. In particular, R0 has been used for determining the minimum coverage of immunization, because the threshold condition to prevent a major epidemic in a randomly-mixing population is given by 1-1/R0 . In addition, R0 gives an estimate of the so-called final size, i.e., the proportion of the population that will experience infection by the end of an epidemic [5,6]. Methodological discussions concerning the statistical inference of R0 are still in progress, and it is recognized that the estimate is very sensitive to dispersal (or underlying epidemiological assumptions) of the progression of a disease . When one estimates R0 using epidemic data of an emerging (or exotic) disease, the exponential growth rate, r, of infections during the initial phase of the epidemic is used [8,9]. Assuming that the generation time, i.e., the time from infection of a primary case to infection of a secondary case generated by the primary case , is known (or separately estimated from other empirical data), the growth rate r is transformed to R0 using that knowledge (see below). That is, the conventional estimation technique has required two statistical steps, namely, first estimate r and then convert r to R0."
PMC2876165,2010-04-30,Age groups and spread of influenza: implications for vaccination strategy," The unpredictable nature of the potentially devastating impact of 2009 pH1N1 influenza pandemic highlights the need for pandemic preparedness planning, where modeling studies could be most useful for simulations of possible future scenarios. METHODS A compartmental model with pre-symptomatic and asymptomatic influenza infections is proposed which incorporates age groups as well as intervention measures such as age-specific vaccination, in order to study spread of influenza in a community. RESULTS We derive the basic reproduction number and other effective reproduction numbers under various intervention measures. For illustration, we make use of the Pneumonia and Influenza (P&I) mortality data and vaccination data of the very young (age 0-2) and the very old (age >64) during 2004-2005 Taiwan winter influenza season to fit our model and to compute the relevant reproduction numbers. The reproduction number for this winter flu season is estimated to be slightly above one (~1.0001). CONCLUSIONS Comparatively large errors in fitting the P&I mortality data of the elderly (>64) were observed shortly after winter school closings in January, which may indicate the impact of younger, more active age groups transmitting influenza to other age groups outside of the school settings; in particular, to the elderly in the households. Pre-symptomatic infections seemed to have little effect on the model fit, while asymptomatic infection by asymptomatic infectives has a more pronounced impact on the model fit for the elderly mortality, perhaps indicating a larger role in disease transmission by asymptomatic infection. Simulations indicate that the impact of vaccination on the disease incidence might not be fully revealed in the change (or the lack thereof) in the effective reproduction number with interventions, but could still be substantial. The estimated per contact transmission probability for susceptible elderly is significantly higher than that of any other age group, perhaps highlighting the vulnerability of the elderly due to close contacts with their caretakers from other age groups. The relative impact of targeting the very young and the very old for vaccination was weakened by their relative inactivity, thus giving evidence of the lack of impact of vaccinating these two groups on the overall transmissibility of the disease in the community. This further underscores the need for morbidity-based strategy to prevent elderly mortality.","In the spring of 2009, the novel H1N1 influenza virus first emerged in Mexico and later spread widely throughout the world within just a few months. The World Health Organization (WHO) announced on June 11 the start of 2009 influenza pandemic , and further issued an advisory on August 28 for countries in the northern hemisphere to prepare for a second wave of pandemic spread in the coming fall/winter . As of November 8, more than 206 countries and overseas territories or communities worldwide have reported laboratory confirmed cases of the pandemic pH1N1 virus, including over 6250 deaths . To lessen the severity of this pandemic, developing an effective flu vaccine and a global vaccination strategy is considered to be among the most important medical interventions . However, to have the greatest impact, pandemic vaccines need to be available quickly and in large quantities, and to be delivered to the population optimally. Moreover, vaccines against a novel pandemic strain might take up to six months to manufacture and deliver, even in developed countries . Given the potential threat of drug-resistance resulting from widespread use of antiviral treatment against pandemic flu, vaccine appears to be our primary weapon to prevent and to mitigate a pandemic. However, in addition to the need to consider the logistics of implementing large-scale vaccination, distinctly different age-specific mortalities had also been observed during some past flu pandemics (e.g., in 1918 ), which require different priorities when large-scale vaccination is to be implemented."
PMC2944876,2010-09-23,Evolutionary Entropy Determines Invasion Success in Emergent Epidemics," Standard epidemiological theory claims that in structured populations competition between multiple pathogen strains is a deterministic process which is mediated by the basic reproduction number ([Image see text]) of the individual strains. A new theory based on analysis, simulation and empirical study challenges this predictor of success. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS We show that the quantity [Image see text] is a valid predictor in structured populations only when size is infinite. In this article we show that when population size is finite the dynamics of infection by multi-strain pathogens is a stochastic process whose outcome can be predicted by evolutionary entropy, S, an information theoretic measure which describes the uncertainty in the infectious age of an infected parent of a randomly chosen new infective. Evolutionary entropy characterises the demographic stability or robustness of the population of infectives. This statistical parameter determines the duration of infection and thus provides a quantitative index of the pathogenicity of a strain. Standard epidemiological theory based on [Image see text] as a measure of selective advantage is the limit as the population size tends to infinity of the entropic selection theory. The standard model is an approximation to the entropic selection theory whose validity increases with population size. CONCLUSION An epidemiological analysis based on entropy is shown to explain empirical observations regarding the emergence of less pathogenic strains of human influenza during the antigenic drift phase. Furthermore, we exploit the entropy perspective to discuss certain epidemiological patterns of the current H1N1 swine 'flu outbreak.","Recent years have seen an apparent acceleration in the rate of emergence of new infectious disease pathogens in the human population . Some of these have their origins in animal (wild or domesticated) reservoirs –, and the years since 2003 have witnessed the appearance of SARS ,  and swine flu . The 20th century saw, for example, the emergence of pandemic 'flu in 1918, 1957 and 1968 (with a limited H1N1 re-emergent outbreak in 1977) , avian 'flu  and the rise of HIV in the 1980's , . Additionally, antibiotic-resistant pathogens have become increasingly widespread in the past decade, particularly in healthcare settings . Antigenically-variable pathogens are responsible for much of the burden of communicable disease in the world today. Therefore, developing an understanding of the factors that lead to the emergence and spread of novel pathogenic agents and strains is a topic of great interest. In recent months the emergence of a swine ‘flu (H1N1 2009) with human-to-human transmission capability has re-focussed attention on this issue , . Likewise, studies, such of those of Creanza et al.  who used a computational analysis of viral nucleotide and amino acid sequence data collected during seasonal 'flu epidemics show how diversity declines over the course of an epidemic. These observations underscore the role that ecological constraint play in the evolution of pathogens. For antigenically variable pathogens it is competition between strains that is the fundamental mechanism which determines the observed patterns of disease spread and prevalence. Diseases in this category include influenza A virus, meningococcal and pneumococcal bacterial infection, malaria and dengue fever, to name but a few. The principal epidemiological characteristics of such diseases are the absence of life-long protective immunity, cross-reactive immunity between strains and the potential for future re-infection. Each strain is in competition with the others for resources. In this case the resources are susceptible hosts, and dominance goes to those variants that are able to outpace their neighbours in their ability to infect susceptibles. From a Darwinian perspective it is the “fittest” strains that will dominate. Translating the qualitative notion of fitness into quantitative terms constitutes one of the fundamental problems in evolutionary epidemiology."
PMC3048541,2011-02-02,"The GLEaMviz computational tool, a publicly available software to explore realistic epidemic spreading scenarios at the global scale"," Computational models play an increasingly important role in the assessment and control of public health crises, as demonstrated during the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic. Much research has been done in recent years in the development of sophisticated data-driven models for realistic computer-based simulations of infectious disease spreading. However, only a few computational tools are presently available for assessing scenarios, predicting epidemic evolutions, and managing health emergencies that can benefit a broad audience of users including policy makers and health institutions. RESULTS We present ""GLEaMviz"", a publicly available software system that simulates the spread of emerging human-to-human infectious diseases across the world. The GLEaMviz tool comprises three components the client application, the proxy middleware, and the simulation engine. The latter two components constitute the GLEaMviz server. The simulation engine leverages on the Global Epidemic and Mobility (GLEaM) framework, a stochastic computational scheme that integrates worldwide high-resolution demographic and mobility data to simulate disease spread on the global scale. The GLEaMviz design aims at maximizing flexibility in defining the disease compartmental model and configuring the simulation scenario; it allows the user to set a variety of parameters including compartment-specific features, transition values, and environmental effects. The output is a dynamic map and a corresponding set of charts that quantitatively describe the geo-temporal evolution of the disease. The software is designed as a client-server system. The multi-platform client, which can be installed on the user's local machine, is used to set up simulations that will be executed on the server, thus avoiding specific requirements for large computational capabilities on the user side. CONCLUSIONS The user-friendly graphical interface of the GLEaMviz tool, along with its high level of detail and the realism of its embedded modeling approach, opens up the platform to simulate realistic epidemic scenarios. These features make the GLEaMviz computational tool a convenient teaching/training tool as well as a first step toward the development of a computational tool aimed at facilitating the use and exploitation of computational models for the policy making and scenario analysis of infectious disease outbreaks.","The 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic highlighted the importance of computational epidemic models for the real-time analysis of the health emergency related to the global spreading of new emerging infectious diseases [1-3]. Realistic computational models are highly complex and sophisticated, integrating substantial amounts of data that characterize the population and geographical context in order to attain superior accuracy, resolution, and predictive power [4-10]. The challenge consists in developing models that are able to capture the complexity of the real world at various levels by taking advantage of current information technology to provide an in silico framework for testing control scenarios that can anticipate the unfolding of an epidemic. At the same time, these computational approaches should be translated into tools accessible by a broader set of users who are the main actors in the decision-making process of health policy, especially during an emergency like an influenza pandemic. The tradeoff between realistic and accurate descriptions of large-scale dynamics, flexibility, computational feasibility, ease of use, and accessibility of these tools creates a major challenge from both the theoretical and the computational points of view [4,5,11,10,13]. GLEaMviz is a client-server software system that can model the world-wide spread of epidemics for human transmissible diseases like influenza-like illnesses (ILI), offering extensive flexibility in the design of the compartmental model and scenario setup, including computationally-optimized numerical simulations based on high-resolution global demographic and mobility data. GLEaMviz makes use of a stochastic and discrete computational scheme to model epidemic spread called ""GLEaM"" - GLobal Epidemic and Mobility model, presented in previously published work [6,3,14] - which is based on a geo-referenced metapopulation approach that considers 3,362 subpopulations in 220 countries of the world, as well as air travel flow connections and short-range commuting data. The software includes a client application with a graphical user interface (GUI) for setting up and executing simulations, and retrieving and visualizing the results; the client application is publicly downloadable. The server application can be requested by public institutions and research centers; conditions of use and possible restrictions will be evaluated specifically. The tool is currently not suitable for the simulation of vector-borne diseases, infection transmission depending on local contact patterns such as sexually transmitted diseases and diseases with a time scale that would make demographic effects relevant. The tool, however, allows the introduction of mitigation policies at the global level. Localized intervention in space or time can be implemented in the GLEaM model and their introduction in the GLEaMviz computational tool are planned for future releases."
PMC3060167,2011-03-17,Autonomous Targeting of Infectious Superspreaders Using Engineered Transmissible Therapies,"Infectious disease treatments, both pharmaceutical and vaccine, face three universal challenges the difficulty of targeting treatments to high-risk ‘superspreader’ populations who drive the great majority of disease spread, behavioral barriers in the host population (such as poor compliance and risk disinhibition), and the evolution of pathogen resistance. Here, we describe a proposed intervention that would overcome these challenges by capitalizing upon Therapeutic Interfering Particles (TIPs) that are engineered to replicate conditionally in the presence of the pathogen and spread between individuals — analogous to ‘transmissible immunization’ that occurs with live-attenuated vaccines (but without the potential for reversion to virulence). Building on analyses of HIV field data from sub-Saharan Africa, we construct a multi-scale model, beginning at the single-cell level, to predict the effect of TIPs on individual patient viral loads and ultimately population-level disease prevalence. Our results show that a TIP, engineered with properties based on a recent HIV gene-therapy trial, could stably lower HIV/AIDS prevalence by ∼30-fold within 50 years and could complement current therapies. In contrast, optimistic antiretroviral therapy or vaccination campaigns alone could only lower HIV/AIDS prevalence by <2-fold over 50 years. The TIP's efficacy arises from its exploitation of the same risk factors as the pathogen, allowing it to autonomously penetrate superspreader populations, maintain efficacy despite behavioral disinhibition, and limit viral resistance. While demonstrated here for HIV, the TIP concept could apply broadly to many viral infectious diseases and would represent a new paradigm for disease control, away from pathogen eradication but toward robust disease suppression.","The TIP concept capitalizes upon and extends the phenomenon of interfering particles that occur naturally in many viruses, spread along with the viral pathogen , and have demonstrated potential therapeutic efficacy against HIV , , , . TIPs are minimal versions of the pathogen engineered to lack the virulent replication and structural genes of the wild-type pathogen and instead encode therapeutic elements that target key host or viral processes. Since a TIP genome is significantly shorter than the wild-type virus genome, TIP genomes are synthesized at a faster rate, resulting in increased numbers of TIP genomes compared to wild-type virus genomes in the infected cell (see Text S1 and ). Specifically, for HIV, the proposed TIP is a lentiviral gene-therapy vector that lacks all structural and envelope genes required to self-replicate, but retains HIV's genomic packaging signals. The TIP can mobilize out of the infected cell only by co-opting wild-type HIV capsid and envelope gene-products . By parasitizing a pathogen's resources, TIPs mobilize from cell to cell ,  and, in a recent clinical trial, this mobilization of a gene-therapy vector against HIV did not appear to be detrimental to patient health . Due to their ability to mobilize and reproduce within hosts, TIPs have the potential to decrease wild-type pathogen levels in vivo by many orders of magnitude . By sharing all packaging elements with the wild-type pathogen, TIPs also have the potential to spread between individuals , and would spread via the same transmission routes as the disease-causing pathogen. In this respect, combating an infectious disease using TIPs raises unique safety and ethical concerns but bears similarity to the use of live attenuated vaccines. In particular, a recognized advantage of Oral Polio Vaccine (OPV) is that it replicates in vivo and sheds, thereby transmitting among susceptible hosts and delivering additional protection via ‘transmissible immunization’ at the population scale . There are, however, crucial differences between TIPs and live attenuated vaccines (i) TIPs cannot replicate in uninfected hosts and, at most, the TIP will remain dormant until the host is coinfected by wildtype pathogen ; and (ii) replication elements are missing from the TIP, so, unlike OPV, TIP cannot revert to virulence in healthy individuals."
PMC3086881,2011-05-03,Transmission Potential of Chikungunya Virus and Control Measures: The Case of Italy,"During summer 2007 Italy has experienced an epidemic caused by Chikungunya virus – the first large outbreak documented in a temperate climate country – with approximately 161 laboratory confirmed cases concentrated in two bordering villages in North–Eastern Italy comprising 3,968 inhabitants. The seroprevalence was recently estimated to be 10.2%. In this work we provide estimates of the transmission potential of the virus and we assess the efficacy of the measures undertaken by public health authorities to control the epidemic spread. To such aim, we developed a model describing the temporal dynamics of the competent vector, known as Aedes albopictus, explicitly depending on climatic factors, coupled to an epidemic transmission model describing the spread of the epidemic in both humans and mosquitoes. The cumulative number of notified cases predicted by the model was 185 on average (95% CI 117–278), in good agreement with observed data. The probability of observing a major outbreak after the introduction of an infective human case was estimated to be in the range of 32%–76%. We found that the basic reproduction number was in the range of 1.8–6 but it could have been even larger, depending on the density of mosquitoes, which in turn depends on seasonal meteorological effects, besides other local abiotic factors. These results confirm the increasing risk of tropical vector–borne diseases in temperate climate countries, as a consequence of globalization. However, our results show that an epidemic can be controlled by performing a timely intervention, even if the transmission potential of Chikungunya virus is sensibly high.","During summer 2007 Italy has experienced the first large outbreak caused by Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) documented in a temperate climate country . CHIKV is an arthropod–borne virus which can be transmitted to humans by Aedes mosquitoes , widespread in some tropical regions –. Aedes albopictus is highly competent for CHIKV , . In Italy, the presence of this mosquito was first documented in Genoa and Padua (Northern Italy) in the earliest 1990's , . Over the following years, Aedes albopictus expanded its distribution and is now well established in Northern and Central Italy , . Having the potential to colonize the Mediterranean basin , the species has been reported from most Mediterranean European countries . Samples of Aedes albopictus from the two villages were found to be positive for CHIKV sequences . Sustained transmission of CHIKV was mainly observed in two neighboring villages in Emilia–Romagna region (North–Eastern Italy), namely Castiglione di Cervia and Castiglione di Ravenna , comprising 3,968 inhabitants in a built–up area of about 70 ha. The two villages are separated by a river with relatively stagnant water resulting from the presence of a lock. Houses are typically low (two storeys), surrounded by small gardens with many flowers, plants and flower pots. During the outbreak in the streets, drainage systems were visible, indicating open stagnant water underground ."
PMC3119673,2011-06-21,Spatial and Temporal Characteristics of the 2009 A/H1N1 Influenza Pandemic in Peru," Highly refined surveillance data on the 2009 A/H1N1 influenza pandemic are crucial to quantify the spatial and temporal characteristics of the pandemic. There is little information about the spatial-temporal dynamics of pandemic influenza in South America. Here we provide a quantitative description of the age-specific morbidity pandemic patterns across administrative areas of Peru. METHODS We used daily cases of influenza-like-illness, tests for A/H1N1 influenza virus infections, and laboratory-confirmed A/H1N1 influenza cases reported to the epidemiological surveillance system of Peru's Ministry of Health from May 1 to December 31, 2009. We analyzed the geographic spread of the pandemic waves and their association with the winter school vacation period, demographic factors, and absolute humidity. We also estimated the reproduction number and quantified the association between the winter school vacation period and the age distribution of cases. RESULTS The national pandemic curve revealed a bimodal winter pandemic wave, with the first peak limited to school age children in the Lima metropolitan area, and the second peak more geographically widespread. The reproduction number was estimated at 1.6–2.2 for the Lima metropolitan area and 1.3–1.5 in the rest of Peru. We found a significant association between the timing of the school vacation period and changes in the age distribution of cases, while earlier pandemic onset was correlated with large population size. By contrast there was no association between pandemic dynamics and absolute humidity. CONCLUSIONS Our results indicate substantial spatial variation in pandemic patterns across Peru, with two pandemic waves of varying timing and impact by age and region. Moreover, the Peru data suggest a hierarchical transmission pattern of pandemic influenza A/H1N1 driven by large population centers. The higher reproduction number of the first pandemic wave could be explained by high contact rates among school-age children, the age group most affected during this early wave.","Although a few quantitative studies have started to shed light on the spatial, temporal, and age specific patterns of mortality and transmissibility levels of historical pandemic events , relatively little is known about the spatial-temporal patterns of the 2009 A/H1N1 influenza pandemic at different spatial scales. For instance, historical influenza pandemics have been characterized by a disproportionate impact on morbidity and mortality rates among young individuals, a feature that is in stark contrast with seasonal influenza epidemics . Also, influenza pandemics have been found to disseminate in multiple waves occurring over short time periods. Furthermore, out-of-season influenza activity has been documented in spring and summer months in temperate countries during the 1918 influenza pandemic , ,  and the recent 2009 influenza pandemic , . The 2009 A/H1N1 influenza pandemic represents a unique opportunity to increase our understanding of the spatial-temporal diffusion patterns of pandemic influenza at different spatial scales, which is crucial for improving public health interventions against future influenza pandemics. In particular, the role of school closure and environmental forcing on the transmission dynamics of pandemic influenza remains debated , 
, , . Peru is a particularly interesting case study in this respect as it covers a variety of climatic zones associated with diverse influenza seasonal patterns  and public health authorities moved the national winter school vacation period by 2-weeks, in an attempt to mitigate the impact of the 2009 A/H1N1 pandemic. Whether the winter school vacation period had any impact on the transmission dynamics of the pandemic in Peru has yet to be evaluated, and this could provide insight into the role of school closures on control of future pandemics , , , , . Here we analyze the spatial patterns of age-specific time series of influenza-like-illness (ILI) and laboratory confirmed A/H1N1 influenza cases collected in Peru during 2009. We also quantify the association between local pandemic patterns, absolute humidity, and demographic factors."
PMC3226987,2007-10-04,Quantifying social distancing arising from pandemic influenza,"Local epidemic curves during the 1918–1919 influenza pandemic were often characterized by multiple epidemic waves. Identifying the underlying cause(s) of such waves may help manage future pandemics. We investigate the hypothesis that these waves were caused by people avoiding potentially infectious contacts—a behaviour termed ‘social distancing’. We estimate the effective disease reproduction number and from it infer the maximum degree of social distancing that occurred during the course of the multiple-wave epidemic in Sydney, Australia. We estimate that, on average across the city, people reduced their infectious contact rate by as much as 38%, and that this was sufficient to explain the multiple waves of this epidemic. The basic reproduction number, R, was estimated to be in the range of 1.6–2.0 with a preferred estimate of 1.8, in line with other recent estimates for the 1918–1919 influenza pandemic. The data are also consistent with a high proportion (more than 90%) of the population being initially susceptible to clinical infection, and the proportion of infections that were asymptomatic (if this occurs) being no higher than approximately 9%. The observed clinical attack rate of 36.6% was substantially lower than the 59% expected based on the estimated value of R, implying that approximately 22% of the population were spared from clinical infection. This reduction in the clinical attack rate translates to an estimated 260 per 100 000 lives having been saved, and suggests that social distancing interventions could play a major role in mitigating the public health impact of future influenza pandemics.","Infectious diseases are commonly controlled by minimizing contact between infectious and susceptible individuals. Personal measures to reduce potentially infectious contacts are sometimes referred to as ‘social distancing’. It has been suggested that policies encouraging social distancing may be effective against pandemic influenza (Bell et al. 2006; Glass et al. 2006). It is unclear, however, whether individuals can reduce their infectious contact rate to a level low enough to return a worthwhile public health outcome. An examination of levels of social distancing actually achieved during previous epidemics can provide useful guidance as to the effectiveness of social distancing interventions during future influenza pandemics. The infectiousness of a disease is characterized by the basic reproduction number (R0), which for our purposes is the expected number of infectious contacts per infective when there are no pharmaceutical or behavioural interventions in place and every individual is equally susceptible. More sophisticated definitions are required where individuals have substantially different risks of infection; the methods described by Diekmann & Heesterbeek  are useful in defining and calculating R0 when contact structures and other kinds of heterogeneity are important. In practice, when an epidemic occurs, the effective reproduction number (R) differs from R0 due to the deployment of interventions, the build-up of herd immunity and possibly pre-existing immunity."
PMC3243394,2012-02-07,Essential epidemiological mechanisms underpinning the transmission dynamics of seasonal influenza,"Seasonal influenza has considerable impact around the world, both economically and in mortality among risk groups, but there is considerable uncertainty as to the essential mechanisms and their parametrization. In this paper, we identify a number of characteristic features of influenza incidence time series in temperate regions, including ranges of annual attack rates and outbreak durations. By constraining the output of simple models to match these characteristic features, we investigate the role played by population heterogeneity, multiple strains, cross-immunity and the rate of strain evolution in the generation of incidence time series. Results indicate that an age-structured model with non-random mixing and co-circulating strains are both required to match observed time-series data. Our work gives estimates of the seasonal peak basic reproduction number, R, in the range 1.6–3. Estimates of R are strongly correlated with the timescale for waning of immunity to current circulating seasonal influenza strain, which we estimate is between 3 and 8 years. Seasonal variation in transmissibility is largely confined to 15–30% of its mean value. While population heterogeneity and cross-immunity are required mechanisms, the degree of heterogeneity and cross-immunity is not tightly constrained. We discuss our findings in the context of other work fitting to seasonal influenza data.","Seasonal influenza causes significant levels of morbidity and mortality around the world each year, yet its dynamics and the annual sequence of pathogen subtypes are hard to predict . Understanding the mechanisms underlying the annual behaviour of influenza and their sensitivity to parameters is important for the forecasting and control of seasonal epidemics and also in assessing the effect of the introduction of novel antigenic strains. The 2009 H1N1 pandemic is a recent example . The initial outbreak of this novel H1N1 strain occurred in spring and summer, ‘out of season’ in the Northern Hemisphere. Uncertainty with regard to intensity of transmission during summer substantially complicated forecasting of the likely trajectory of the epidemic over the following months. Many respiratory transmissible diseases exhibit seasonal epidemics. Annual periodic forcing causes a wide range of oscillatory epidemic behaviour, as illustrated by incidence rates for measles and pertussis [3–5]. The source of seasonal forcing in those cases is largely attributed to annual variations in the intensity of contact between children, but a range of other mechanisms have been proposed. In the case of influenza, two recent hypotheses have centred on variation in vitamin D levels and air humidity [6,7]."
PMC3247203,2011-12-02,Transmissibility and temporal changes of 2009 pH1N1 pandemic during summer and fall/winter waves," In order to compare the transmissibility of the 2009 pH1N1 pandemic during successive waves of infections in summer and fall/winter in the Northern Hemisphere, and to assess the temporal changes during the course of the outbreak in relation to the intervention measures implemented, we analyze the epidemiological patterns of the epidemic in Taiwan during July 2009-March 2010. METHODS We utilize the multi-phase Richards model to fit the weekly cumulative pH1N1 epidemiological data (numbers of confirmed cases and hospitalizations) as well as the daily number of classes suspended under a unique ""325"" partial school closing policy in Taiwan, in order to pinpoint the turning points of the summer and fall/winter waves, and to estimate the reproduction numbers R for each wave. RESULTS Our analysis indicates that the summer wave had slowed down by early September when schools reopened for fall. However, a second fall/winter wave began in late September, approximately 4 weeks after the school reopened, peaking at about 2-3 weeks after the start of the mass immunization campaign in November. R is estimated to be in the range of 1.04-1.27 for the first wave, and between 1.01-1.05 for the second wave. CONCLUSIONS Transmissibility of the summer wave in Taiwan during July-early September, as measured by R, was lower than that of the earlier spring outbreak in North America and Europe, as well as that of the winter outbreak in Southern Hemisphere. Furthermore, transmissibility during fall/winter in Taiwan was noticeably lower than that of the summer, which is attributable to population-level immunity acquired from the earlier summer wave and also to the intervention measures that were implemented prior to and during the fall/winter wave.","Although the first known imported case of 2009 pandemic influenza (pH1N1) arrived in Taiwan on May 18 from the U.S. via Hong Kong, Serological evidence has indicated that the pH1N1 virus had spread to central Taiwan by April-June . Local infections and laboratory-confirmed pH1N1 cases in Taiwan started to mount in significant numbers in July-August when the schools were in summer recess. By the time the schools reopened in September, multiple intervention measures had been implemented by the government, which include strict border temperature screening starting in May, a ""325"" class suspension policy [2,3] implemented in September, and later a mass immunization program [3-5] starting in November. The number of cases began to decline by the end of the year, and continued to do so into early next year, until the government announced on February 23 the end of the fall/winter outbreak  with over 3000 laboratory-confirmed cases reported, 910 hospitalizations, and 41 deaths . Although school closing was a widely used method of intervention around the world during the pH1N1 outbreak (see, e.g., [8-13]), its suitability, timing, and the manner of implementation remains controversial. When K-12 schools (kindergarten through high schools) reopened on August 31 in Taiwan, the government implemented a unique partial school closing policy called the ""325"" class suspension policy aimed toward kindergarten through secondary schools (K-9), cram schools, and after-school institutions. Under this policy, if within any three  consecutive school days, two  or more students in the same class are diagnosed with influenza, then that class will be suspended for the next five  days including weekends and holidays [2,3]. The policy was designed to minimize the potential social impact of full-scale school closings in the event of a major influenza outbreak in the community; to detect cluster infections in school settings early and swiftly; and to contain the infections locally without disruption for the other students in the school. At the height of the class suspensions in late November, more than 1800 classes with more than 50,000 students from almost 800 schools in Taiwan were suspended on a single school day (Figure 1), yet without any visible disruption in the normal functioning of the society."
PMC3317585,2011-02-25,The impact of media coverage on the transmission dynamics of human influenza," There is an urgent need to understand how the provision of information influences individual risk perception and how this in turn shapes the evolution of epidemics. Individuals are influenced by information in complex and unpredictable ways. Emerging infectious diseases, such as the recent swine flu epidemic, may be particular hotspots for a media-fueled rush to vaccination; conversely, seasonal diseases may receive little media attention, despite their high mortality rate, due to their perceived lack of newness. METHODS We formulate a deterministic transmission and vaccination model to investigate the effects of media coverage on the transmission dynamics of influenza. The population is subdivided into different classes according to their disease status. The compartmental model includes the effect of media coverage on reporting the number of infections as well as the number of individuals successfully vaccinated. RESULTS A threshold parameter (the basic reproductive ratio) is analytically derived and used to discuss the local stability of the disease-free steady state. The impact of costs that can be incurred, which include vaccination, education, implementation and campaigns on media coverage, are also investigated using optimal control theory. A simplified version of the model with pulse vaccination shows that the media can trigger a vaccinating panic if the vaccine is imperfect and simplified messages result in the vaccinated mixing with the infectives without regard to disease risk. CONCLUSIONS The effects of media on an outbreak are complex. Simplified understandings of disease epidemiology, propogated through media soundbites, may make the disease significantly worse.","Infectious diseases are responsible for a quarter of all deaths in the world annually, the vast majority occurring in low- and middle-income countries . There are diseases such as SARS and flu that exhibit some distinct features such as rapid spatial spread and visible symptoms . These features, associated with the increasing trend of globalization and the development of information technology, are expected to be shared by other emerging/re-emerging infectious diseases. It is therefore important to refine classical mathematical models to reflect these features by adding the dimensions of massive news coverage that have great influence not only on the individual behaviours but also on the formation and implementation of public intervention and control policies . People’s response to the threat of disease is dependent on their perception of risk, which is influenced by public and private information disseminated widely by the media. While government agencies for disease control and prevention may attempt to contain the disease , the general information disseminated to the public is often restricted to simply reporting the number of infections and deaths. Mass media are widely acknowleged as key tools in risk communication [4,5], but have been criticised for making risk a spectacle to capitalise on audience anxiety [6,7]."
PMC3325179,2012-04-12,Quantifying Type-Specific Reproduction Numbers for Nosocomial Pathogens: Evidence for Heightened Transmission of an Asian Sequence Type 239 MRSA Clone,"An important determinant of a pathogen's success is the rate at which it is transmitted from infected to susceptible hosts. Although there are anecdotal reports that methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) clones vary in their transmissibility in hospital settings, attempts to quantify such variation are lacking for common subtypes, as are methods for addressing this question using routinely-collected MRSA screening data in endemic settings. Here we present a method to quantify the time-varying transmissibility of different subtypes of common bacterial nosocomial pathogens using routine surveillance data. The method adapts approaches for estimating reproduction numbers based on the probabilistic reconstruction of epidemic trees, but uses relative hazards rather than serial intervals to assign probabilities to different sources for observed transmission events. The method is applied to data collected as part of a retrospective observational study of a concurrent MRSA outbreak in the United Kingdom with dominant endemic MRSA clones (ST22 and ST36) and an Asian ST239 MRSA strain (ST239-TW) in two linked adult intensive care units, and compared with an approach based on a fully parametric transmission model. The results provide support for the hypothesis that the clones responded differently to an infection control measure based on the use of topical antiseptics, which was more effective at reducing transmission of endemic clones. They also suggest that in one of the two ICUs patients colonized or infected with the ST239-TW MRSA clone had consistently higher risks of transmitting MRSA to patients free of MRSA. These findings represent some of the first quantitative evidence of enhanced transmissibility of a pandemic MRSA lineage, and highlight the potential value of tailoring hospital infection control measures to specific pathogen subtypes.","Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is responsible for a high burden of morbidity and mortality worldwide –. While community-associated MRSA is becoming increasingly important globally , , in many countries, including the United Kingdom, MRSA remains predominantly a nosocomial pathogen , . The dominant sequence type (ST) in Asia is ST239, and recent analysis of whole-genome sequence data has shown that this ST has distinct lineages in Asia, Europe and South America which probably share a European ancestor –. Little is known about what has enabled this ST to be so successful, or whether its propensity to transmit between hosts differs from other MRSA types in certain settings. A recent concurrent outbreak due to an ST239 MRSA strain (ST239-TW, subsequently referred to as TW) and the two dominant endemic UK MRSA types (ST22 and ST36, which we refer to as non-TW) in two linked adult intensive care units in a London teaching hospital provided a rare opportunity to compare the transmissibility of different MRSA types in the same clinical setting . The transmissibility of a potentially emerging pathogen (the rate at which it spreads from an infected host to exposed susceptible hosts) is an important factor in determining its success and, in the case of an established pathogen, for estimating how effective interventions must be to bring an epidemic under control , . Quantifying the degree to which strains of a nosocomial pathogen differ in their transmissibility in a particular setting could lead to a better understanding of why major clonal replacements occur. Measuring how such transmissibility changes in response to interventions would allow us to quantify the value of specific control measures, which may vary according to the strain . This could lead to better resource use by allowing us to choose control measures appropriate for the specific strain. Such an analysis has greatest relevance for predominantly clonal organisms, such as S. aureus, where distinct lineages cocirculate over extended periods of time ."
PMC3509329,2012-11-29,What was the primary mode of smallpox transmission? Implications for biodefense,"The mode of infection transmission has profound implications for effective containment by public health interventions. The mode of smallpox transmission was never conclusively established. Although, “respiratory droplet” transmission was generally regarded as the primary mode of transmission, the relative importance of large ballistic droplets and fine particle aerosols that remain suspended in air for more than a few seconds was never resolved. This review examines evidence from the history of variolation, data on mucosal infection collected in the last decades of smallpox transmission, aerosol measurements, animal models, reports of smallpox lung among healthcare workers, and the epidemiology of smallpox regarding the potential importance of fine particle aerosol mediated transmission. I introduce briefly the term anisotropic infection to describe the behavior of Variola major in which route of infection appears to have altered the severity of disease.","Controversy exists regarding the best method of protecting the public against the potential release of smallpox as a biological weapon (Bicknell, 2002; Fauci, 2002; Halloran et al., 2002; Kaplan et al., 2002; Mack, 2003). Infectious disease modeling plays an important role in this dialog, and the biology of the transmission pathway, the focus of this review, is critical to producing appropriate predictive models and understanding which controls will work best under varying conditions (Ferguson et al., 2003). The rapidity with which smallpox would spread in a developed nation is not known and is a major source of uncertainty in models used for public health planning (Ferguson et al., 2003). The basic reproductive number (R0), which describes the tendency of a disease to spread, has been estimated for smallpox from historical data and outbreaks in developing countries (Gani and Leach, 2001; Eichner and Dietz, 2003). Because R0 is a function of the contact rate between individuals, it can be affected by changes in the environment (Anderson and May, 1991). A potentially important difference between contemporary environments and those used to estimate R0 is that today many buildings, including hospitals, mechanically recirculate air. If smallpox was almost entirely transmitted by mucosal contact with large droplets (aerodynamic diameters >10 μm), which can only occur following “face-to-face” exposure over distances of a few feet, then change in the built environment would not change the contact rate between individuals. If, however, smallpox was frequently transmitted from person-to-person by airborne droplet nuclei [fine particles with aerodynamic diameters of ≤2.5 μm capable of remaining suspended in air for hours and of depositing in the lower lung (Hinds, 1999)] then mechanically recirculated air systems would increase the contact rate, R0, the risk of epidemic spread, and the difficulty of hospital infection control. Unfortunately, leading authorities disagree regarding the relative importance of fine and large particle routes of transmission; some state that smallpox was transmitted primarily via airborne droplet nuclei, (Henderson et al., 1999) while others emphasize “face-to-face” contact and state that, airborne transmission was rare (Centers for Disease Control, 2002; Mack, 2003). This paper reviews the evidence for each of these modes of transmission."
PMC3518181,2012-11-13,The influence of climatic conditions on the transmission dynamics of the 2009 A/H1N1 influenza pandemic in Chile," The role of demographic factors, climatic conditions, school cycles, and connectivity patterns in shaping the spatio-temporal dynamics of pandemic influenza is not clearly understood. Here we analyzed the spatial, age and temporal evolution of the 2009 A/H1N1 influenza pandemic in Chile, a southern hemisphere country covering a long and narrow strip comprising latitudes 17°S to 56°S. METHODS We analyzed the dissemination patterns of the 2009 A/H1N1 pandemic across 15 regions of Chile based on daily hospitalizations for severe acute respiratory disease and laboratory confirmed A/H1N1 influenza infection from 01-May to 31-December, 2009. We explored the association between timing of pandemic onset and peak pandemic activity and several geographical and demographic indicators, school vacations, climatic factors, and international passengers. We also estimated the reproduction number (R) based on the growth rate of the exponential pandemic phase by date of symptoms onset, estimated using maximum likelihood methods. RESULTS While earlier pandemic onset was associated with larger population size, there was no association with connectivity, demographic, school or climatic factors. In contrast, there was a latitudinal gradient in peak pandemic timing, representing a 16-39-day lag in disease activity from the southern regions relative to the northernmost region (P < 0.001). Geographical differences in latitude of Chilean regions, maximum temperature and specific humidity explained 68.5% of the variability in peak timing (P = 0.01). In addition, there was a decreasing gradient in reproduction number from south to north Chile (P < 0.0001). The regional mean R estimates were 1.6-2.0, 1.3-1.5, and 1.2-1.3 for southern, central and northern regions, respectively, which were not affected by the winter vacation period. CONCLUSIONS There was a lag in the period of most intense 2009 pandemic influenza activity following a South to North traveling pattern across regions of Chile, significantly associated with geographical differences in minimum temperature and specific humidity. The latitudinal gradient in timing of pandemic activity was accompanied by a gradient in reproduction number (P < 0.0001). Intensified surveillance strategies in colder and drier southern regions could lead to earlier detection of pandemic influenza viruses and improved control outcomes.","Increasing our understanding of host, environmental, and pathogen specific factors modulating the transmissibility and spatio-temporal dynamics of pandemic influenza has the potential to guide mitigation and surveillance strategies. Several factors have been put forward as potential drivers of the spatio-temporal dynamics of influenza pandemics, including population contact rates, travel patterns, climatic conditions, and geography. Recent studies of the 2009 A/H1N1 influenza pandemic have quantified the role of demographic factors, school cycles and social distancing measures (e.g., school closure) on disease transmission
[1-5], but their effect combined with climatic factors is less clear
[6,7]. In particular, experimental studies indicate that aerosol transmission of 2009 A/H1N1 influenza is sensitive to temperature and humidity levels
. Moreover, the timing and intensity of the 2009 A/H1N1 pandemic waves varied substantially across regions of the world
[1,2,9-14], suggesting a potential link with local meteorological conditions. Further, the occurrence of recrudescent waves of pandemic activity in the South-Eastern US in winter 2010 was associated with low humidity levels
. The first cases of 2009 A/H1N1 pandemic influenza were confirmed on April 21–23 in California, USA, and Mexico
[16,17], and soon after the pandemic virus became the dominant respiratory virus in the Southern Hemisphere’s temperate countries
[18,19]. Timing of pandemic activity coincided with the typical influenza winter season in this region which spans the months of May-September. Few studies have characterized A/H1N1 transmission dynamics in the Southern Hemisphere
[2,5,20], and no study has explored variation in disease transmission at a small spatial scale in this region. Here we characterized the spatio-temporal dynamics of the 2009 influenza pandemic across Chile, a country which combines an extended latitudinal range with a solid epidemiological surveillance system. In this work, we assessed the relative contribution of environmental conditions, demographic factors, contact rates, and international travel patterns on pandemic A/H1N1 transmission, by modeling a large dataset of weekly hospitalizations for severe acute respiratory infection and laboratory-confirmed A/H1N1 influenza infection in the 15 administrative regions of Chile."
PMC3606600,2013-03-08,Economic analysis of pandemic influenza mitigation strategies for five pandemic severity categories," The threat of emergence of a human-to-human transmissible strain of highly pathogenic influenza A(H5N1) is very real, and is reinforced by recent results showing that genetically modified A(H5N1) may be readily transmitted between ferrets. Public health authorities are hesitant in introducing social distancing interventions due to societal disruption and productivity losses. This study estimates the effectiveness and total cost (from a societal perspective, with a lifespan time horizon) of a comprehensive range of social distancing and antiviral drug strategies, under a range of pandemic severity categories. METHODS An economic analysis was conducted using a simulation model of a community of ~30,000 in Australia. Data from the 2009 pandemic was used to derive relationships between the Case Fatality Rate (CFR) and hospitalization rates for each of five pandemic severity categories, with CFR ranging from 0.1% to 2.5%. RESULTS For a pandemic with basic reproduction number R = 1.8, adopting no interventions resulted in total costs ranging from $441 per person for a pandemic at category 1 (CFR 0.1%) to $8,550 per person at category 5 (CFR 2.5%). For severe pandemics of category 3 (CFR 0.75%) and greater, a strategy combining antiviral treatment and prophylaxis, extended school closure and community contact reduction resulted in the lowest total cost of any strategy, costing $1,584 per person at category 5. This strategy was highly effective, reducing the attack rate to 5%. With low severity pandemics costs are dominated by productivity losses due to illness and social distancing interventions, whereas higher severity pandemic costs are dominated by healthcare costs and costs arising from productivity losses due to death. CONCLUSIONS For pandemics in high severity categories the strategies with the lowest total cost to society involve rigorous, sustained social distancing, which are considered unacceptable for low severity pandemics due to societal disruption and cost.","While the H1N1 2009 virus spread world-wide and was classed as a pandemic, the severity of resulting symptoms, as quantified by morbidity and mortality rates, was lower than that which had previously occurred in many seasonal epidemics [1-3]. The 2009 pandemic thus highlighted a further factor which must be considered when determining which public health intervention strategies to recommend, namely the severity of symptoms arising from a given emergent influenza strain. The mild symptoms of H1N1 2009 resulted in a reluctance of public health authorities to use rigorous social distancing interventions due to their disruptive effects, even though modelling has previously suggested that they could be highly effective in reducing the illness attack rate [4-13]. Had the H1N1 2009 influenza strain been highly pathogenic, more timely and rigorous responses would have been necessary to mitigate the resultant adverse health outcomes. Furthermore, there is continuing concern that a highly pathogenic avian influenza A(H5N1) strain may become transmissible between humans. This scenario is highlighted by the large reservoir of influenza A(H5N1) in poultry in South-East Asia , and recent experimental results which have shown that the A(H5N1) virus may be genetically modified to become readily transmissible between ferrets, a commonly used animal model for human influenza transmission studies [15-17]."
PMC3612822,2013-03-26,Pandemic influenza in Papua New Guinea: a modelling study comparison with pandemic spread in a developed country,"OBJECTIVES The possible occurrence of a highly pathogenic influenza strain is of concern to health authorities worldwide. It is known that during past influenza pandemics developing countries have experienced considerably higher death rates compared with developed countries. Furthermore, many developing countries lack appropriate pandemic preparedness plans. Mathematical modelling studies to guide the development of such plans are largely focused on predicting pandemic influenza spread in developed nations. However, intervention strategies shown by modelling studies to be highly effective for developed countries give limited guidance as to the impact which an influenza pandemic may have on low-income countries given different demographics and resource constraints. To address this, an individual-based model of a Papua New Guinean (PNG) community was created and used to simulate the spread of a novel influenza strain. The results were compared with those obtained from a comparable Australian model. DESIGN A modelling study. SETTING The towns of Madang in PNG (population ∼35 000) and Albany (population ∼30 000) in Australia. OUTCOME MEASURES Daily and cumulative illness attack rates in both models following introduction of a novel influenza strain into a naive population, for an unmitigated scenario and two social distancing intervention scenarios. RESULTS The unmitigated scenario indicated an approximately 50% higher attack rate in PNG compared with the Australian model. The two social distancing-based interventions strategies were 60–70% less effective in a PNG setting compared with an Australian setting. CONCLUSIONS This study provides further evidence that an influenza pandemic occurring in a low-income country such as PNG may have a greater impact than one occurring in a developed country, and that PNG-feasible interventions may be substantially less effective. The larger average household size in PNG, the larger proportion of the population under 18 and greater community-wide contact all contribute to this feature.","Novel influenza virus strains have resulted in pandemics costing millions of lives1 and the possible occurrence of a highly pathogenic virus strain is of concern to health authorities worldwide. It has been shown under laboratory conditions that the highly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza strain may reassort or mutate to become readily transmissible between humans.2 In response to the threat of influenza pandemics, most countries have developed pandemic preparedness plans.3–8 However, the level of completeness of these plans with regard to WHO guidelines9 varies dramatically between developed high-income countries and developing low-income countries.7

PMC3620113,2013-04-08,"Using GPS Technology to Quantify Human Mobility, Dynamic Contacts and Infectious Disease Dynamics in a Resource-Poor Urban Environment","Empiric quantification of human mobility patterns is paramount for better urban planning, understanding social network structure and responding to infectious disease threats, especially in light of rapid growth in urbanization and globalization. This need is of particular relevance for developing countries, since they host the majority of the global urban population and are disproportionally affected by the burden of disease. We used Global Positioning System (GPS) data-loggers to track the fine-scale (within city) mobility patterns of 582 residents from two neighborhoods from the city of Iquitos, Peru. We used ∼2.3 million GPS data-points to quantify age-specific mobility parameters and dynamic co-location networks among all tracked individuals. Geographic space significantly affected human mobility, giving rise to highly local mobility kernels. Most (∼80%) movements occurred within 1 km of an individual’s home. Potential hourly contacts among individuals were highly irregular and temporally unstructured. Only up to 38% of the tracked participants showed a regular and predictable mobility routine, a sharp contrast to the situation in the developed world. As a case study, we quantified the impact of spatially and temporally unstructured routines on the dynamics of transmission of an influenza-like pathogen within an Iquitos neighborhood. Temporally unstructured daily routines (e.g., not dominated by a single location, such as a workplace, where an individual repeatedly spent significant amount of time) increased an epidemic’s final size and effective reproduction number by 20% in comparison to scenarios modeling temporally structured contacts. Our findings provide a mechanistic description of the basic rules that shape human mobility within a resource-poor urban center, and contribute to the understanding of the role of fine-scale patterns of individual movement and co-location in infectious disease dynamics. More generally, this study emphasizes the need for careful consideration of human social interactions when designing infectious disease mitigation strategies, particularly within resource-poor urban environments.","Routine movements of individuals within cities are of paramount importance for planning urban infrastructures , developing transport and commuting alternatives , , improving wireless communication networks , , promoting healthy lifestyles , and preventing or responding to emergence, propagation and persistence of infectious disease –. People routinely engage in activities that vary in relative frequency and duration as well as in geographic location and, more importantly, their spatial behavior can be affected by changes in social and economic contexts . Understanding the statistical patterns that characterize human mobility within cities poses fascinating scientific questions and major methodological, technical and ethical challenges , , particularly when aiming at understanding their role in spatio-temporal human-mediated processes such as infectious disease transmission –. Early mathematical models of infectious diseases assumed individuals as having an equal chance of transmitting and getting exposed to disease agents (i.e., homogenous mixing), ignoring stochastic variations in transmission potential or heterogeneities in contact patterns . Empirical evidence shows that contact rates are indeed highly heterogeneous , , , in part owing to the complex and dynamic fabric of human social relationships , . Therefore, individual social structure and movement patterns play a significant role in modulating contact rates, affecting the transmission, spread and persistence of pathogens and drug resistance , . Inferring infectious disease contact structures from human mobility requires the explicit consideration of the spatial and temporal dimensions of pathogen transmission, which are contingent on the type of pathogen and its mode of transmission . Most mathematical models of directly transmitted pathogens assume that contacts are fixed (edges in a contact network do not change over time or during the duration of an outbreak). In reality, human movement and potential infectious contacts are highly dynamic, and theoretical models have shown that such heterogeneity can have profound impacts on the transmission and stability of disease outbreaks –. In fact, accounting for human commuting behaviors in meta-population models (by simulating working-age individuals’ daily return to their home census district), significantly reduced the speed of propagation and the predicted impact of disease epidemics in comparison to models assuming irregular (probabilistic or random) movements , , , ."
PMC3625221,2013-04-12,The Impact of Model Building on the Transmission Dynamics under Vaccination: Observable (Symptom-Based) versus Unobservable (Contagiousness-Dependent) Approaches," The way we formulate a mathematical model of an infectious disease to capture symptomatic and asymptomatic transmission can greatly influence the likely effectiveness of vaccination in the presence of vaccine effect for preventing clinical illness. The present study aims to assess the impact of model building strategy on the epidemic threshold under vaccination. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS We consider two different types of mathematical models, one based on observable variables including symptom onset and recovery from clinical illness (hereafter, the “observable model”) and the other based on unobservable information of infection event and infectiousness (the “unobservable model”). By imposing a number of modifying assumptions to the observable model, we let it mimic the unobservable model, identifying that the two models are fully consistent only when the incubation period is identical to the latent period and when there is no pre-symptomatic transmission. We also computed the reproduction numbers with and without vaccination, demonstrating that the data generating process of vaccine-induced reduction in symptomatic illness is consistent with the observable model only and examining how the effective reproduction number is differently calculated by two models. CONCLUSIONS To explicitly incorporate the vaccine effect in reducing the risk of symptomatic illness into the model, it is fruitful to employ a model that directly accounts for disease progression. More modeling studies based on observable epidemiological information are called for.","There are two intriguing characteristics in quantitatively modeling infectious disease data. First, the risk of infection to an individual is dependent on the risks of other individuals in the same population unit. Second, the infection event is seldom directly observable. Among these two, the dependence has been addressed during the process of model building, e.g., a heterogeneous contact structure has been explicitly considered in various types of models  and sometimes by examining the conditional risk of infection at a confined setting (e.g. household). On the other hand, it has been common to address the unobservable nature of infection event by employing a convolution equation, i.e. the so-called “backcalculation method”, to infer the time of infection based on the dataset of illness onset –. However, the deconvolution procedure has been frequently dealt with as a statistical technique that is independent of the transmission model , and the process of model building tended to be separated from the unobservable character of infection event. Ignoring the unobservable nature during model formulation would complicate the model fitting to empirical data. In many instances, a temporal distribution of infected individuals (i.e. an epidemic curve) is analyzed, and most frequently, the best available dataset is the daily counts of cases. The data are usually collected based on observable information only, e.g. counts of cases according to the date of diagnosis of clinically apparent illness. Only in the better case, epidemiologists are granted an access to the daily frequency of illness onset. Nevertheless, the data generating process of the empirical information is rather different from assumed transition mechanism within the so-called SIR (susceptible-infectious-removed) model. The SIR model is considered as inconsistent with the data, because the transition from S to I state is determined by the event of infection (which is unobservable) and the other transition from I to R state is determined by the loss of infectiousness (which is even more difficult to observe) . In light of a need to construct a model that better adheres to the observable information, a previous study proposed a novel modeling approach that classifies infected individuals into asymptomatic and symptomatic ones while still adopting a common multistate model structure . In the case of the unobservable SEIR (susceptible-exposed-infectious-removed) model, the model handles unobservable information within the multistate structure, classifying infected individuals into pre-infectious (exposed) and infectious individuals ,  that are not directly distinguishable from each other in empirical observation."
PMC3628338,2013-04-16,Widespread Divergence of the CEACAM/PSG Genes in Vertebrates and Humans Suggests Sensitivity to Selection,"In mammals, carcinoembryonic antigen cell adhesion molecules (CEACAMs) and pregnancy-specific glycoproteins (PSGs) play important roles in the regulation of pathogen transmission, tumorigenesis, insulin signaling turnover, and fetal–maternal interactions. However, how these genes evolved and to what extent they diverged in humans remain to be investigated specifically. Based on syntenic mapping of chordate genomes, we reveal that diverging homologs with a prototypic CEACAM architecture–including an extracellular domain with immunoglobulin variable and constant domain-like regions, and an intracellular domain containing ITAM motif–are present from cartilaginous fish to humans, but are absent in sea lamprey, cephalochordate or urochordate. Interestingly, the CEACAM/PSG gene inventory underwent radical divergence in various vertebrate lineages from zero in avian species to dozens in therian mammals. In addition, analyses of genetic variations in human populations showed the presence of various types of copy number variations (CNVs) at the CEACAM/PSG locus. These copy number polymorphisms have 3–80% frequency in select populations, and encompass single to more than six PSG genes. Furthermore, we found that CEACAM/PSG genes contain a significantly higher density of nonsynonymous single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) compared to the chromosome average, and many CEACAM/PSG SNPs exhibit high population differentiation. Taken together, our study suggested that CEACAM/PSG genes have had a more dynamic evolutionary history in vertebrates than previously thought. Given that CEACAM/PSGs play important roles in maternal–fetal interaction and pathogen recognition, these data have laid the groundwork for future analysis of adaptive CEACAM/PSG genotype-phenotypic relationships in normal and complicated pregnancies as well as other etiologies.","Carcinoembryonic antigen cell adhesion molecules (CEACAMs) and pregnancy-specific glycoproteins (PSGs; also known as Schwangerschafts Protein 1) are characterized by an N-terminal immunoglobulin variable domain-like region followed by a varied number of immunoglobulin constant domain-like structures. The prototypic member, CEA (or CEACAM5), was initially discovered as a membrane-anchored tumor antigen . CEACAM subfamily proteins have since been shown to play important roles in the regulation of immune responses, angiogenesis, the differentiation of mammary glands, insulin signaling turnover, tumorigenesis, and metastasis , , , , , , , , , , . By contrast, PSGs have been characterized as highly glycosylated major proteins from human syncytiotrophoblasts during pregnancy. High levels of human PSGs have been detected in maternal serum as early as 3 days postfertilization, coinciding with the attachment of the blastocyst to the uterine wall, and were believed to be critical for protecting the semiallotypic fetus from the maternal immune system during pregnancy in, at least, primates , , , , , . Whereas the CEACAM/PSG genes were previously considered eutherian-specific, recent studies have shown that homologs with 30–50% protein sequence similarity to human CEACAMs are present in the marsupial opossum and monotreme platypus , . Interestingly, the inventory of CEACAM/PSG genes in mammals appeared to vary greatly even among closely related species. For example, whereas mice contain 27 CEACAM/PSG homologs, rats have only 16 counterparts , . In addition, earlier studies of nucleotide substitution and the dN/dS ratio in primates and rodents showed that select CEACAM/PSG genes underwent positive or purifying selection , . These earlier observations suggested that the duplication/retention of CEACAM/PSG genes could be susceptible to environmental selection, and the process could be similar to the birth, fixation, and loss of adaptive genes such as olfactory receptors and killer-cell immunoglobulin-like receptors (KIRs) in select vertebrates , , . Because the analysis of nucleotide or amino acid selection across closely related species provides only a rough estimate of genetic variation within a narrow time frame, how unique the evolution of CEACAM/PSG genes in vertebrates remains to be investigated. In addition, the difficulty in analyzing CEACAM/PSG gene evolution was further aggravated by the large variation in gene repertoire among species, which violates various assumptions of statistical methods commonly used in the analysis of gene selection. Accordingly, we hypothesized that an integrative analysis that encompasses a wide time spectrum is needed to better understand the evolution of CEACAM/PSG genes. Here, based on syntenic mapping of chordate genomes and the analysis of genetic variations in humans, we show that CEACAM/PSG genes represent an independent branch of the immunoglobulin superfamily, and were frequently subject to selection by gene–environmental interactions. Importantly, we also found that human CEACAM/PSG locus is enriched with genetic variations, and the PSG gene inventory could range from 12 to 30 copies among individuals, indicating an ongoing selection of these genes in major, geographically separated human populations. Because PSGs and CEACAMs are important for normal pregnancy and immune responses, our study thus provides a framework for further exploration of adaptive genotype–phenotype relationships involving these fast-evolving genes in reproduction, pregnancy complications, and other patho-physiologies in humans."
PMC3713830,2013-06-03,Transmission Potential of Rift Valley Fever Virus over the Course of the 2010 Epidemic in South Africa,"A Rift Valley fever (RVF) epidemic affecting animals on domestic livestock farms was reported in South Africa during January–August 2010. The first cases occurred after heavy rainfall, and the virus subsequently spread countrywide. To determine the possible effect of environmental conditions and vaccination on RVF virus transmissibility, we estimated the effective reproduction number (R(e)) for the virus over the course of the epidemic by extending the Wallinga and Teunis algorithm with spatial information. R(e) reached its highest value in mid-February and fell below unity around mid-March, when vaccination coverage was 7.5%–45.7% and vector-suitable environmental conditions were maintained. The epidemic fade-out likely resulted first from the immunization of animals following natural infection or vaccination. The decline in vector-suitable environmental conditions from April onwards and further vaccination helped maintain R(e) below unity. Increased availability of vaccine use data would enable evaluation of the effect of RVF vaccination campaigns.","A total of 470 RVF cases were reported over the study period (January–August 2010). A case was defined as an outbreak reported from a farm raising cattle, small ruminants, or both . Available information comprised the global positioning system coordinates and outbreak starting dates for the affected farms. The Wallinga and Teunis method , extended with spatial information, enables estimation of Re at the farm level by calculating the relative likelihood, or probability (pij), that a specific farm (i) gets infected from another specific farm (j). This probability, pij, is equal to the probability that farm j infects farm i, divided by the probability that farm i had been infected from any other farm (k) in the dataset (Figure 2). These probabilities depend on the number of days separating the onset of symptoms on the 2 farms (i and j) and the distance (in kilometers) separating i and j, and the probabilities were extracted from a probability density function of the generation interval (Technical Appendix). The generation (or serial) interval was defined as the time between onset of symptoms for a primary case and the onset of symptoms for its secondary case . In the stylized example in Figure 2, the most likely time difference was 4 days (determined on the basis of the serial interval distribution, given below the x axis), and the most likely distance is short (<1 km). Therefore, farm j is the most likely farm to have infected farm i (this maximized the probability in both dimensions)."
PMC3735474,2013-07-26,Estimating the reproductive number in the presence of spatial heterogeneity of transmission patterns," Estimates of parameters for disease transmission in large-scale infectious disease outbreaks are often obtained to represent large groups of people, providing an average over a potentially very diverse area. For control measures to be more effective, a measure of the heterogeneity of the parameters is desirable. METHODS We propose a novel extension of a network-based approach to estimating the reproductive number. With this we can incorporate spatial and/or demographic information through a similarity matrix. We apply this to the 2009 Influenza pandemic in South Africa to understand the spatial variability across provinces. We explore the use of five similarity matrices to illustrate their impact on the subsequent epidemic parameter estimates. RESULTS When treating South Africa as a single entity with homogeneous transmission characteristics across the country, the basic reproductive number, R, (and imputation range) is 1.33 (1.31, 1.36). When fitting a new model for each province with no inter-province connections this estimate varies little (1.23-1.37). Using the proposed method with any of the four similarity measures yields an overall R that varies little across the four new models (1.33 to 1.34). However, when allowed to vary across provinces, the estimated R is greater than one consistently in only two of the nine provinces, the most densely populated provinces of Gauteng and Western Cape. CONCLUSIONS Our results suggest that the spatial heterogeneity of influenza transmission was compelling in South Africa during the 2009 pandemic. This variability makes a qualitative difference in our understanding of the epidemic. While the cause of this fluctuation might be partially due to reporting differences, there is substantial evidence to warrant further investigation.","In an emerging outbreak of an infectious disease, such as influenza, there is great interest in determining, amongst other things, its transmissibility, which is typically quantified by its reproductive number. Initially, there is interest in estimation of the idealized basic reproductive number, R0, which measures the average number of cases generated by an infected individual in an entirely susceptible population. Post hoc analyses of an outbreak may include estimation of the time-varying effective reproductive number, Rt, which represents the impact on R0 of acquired immunity and public health interventions that typically lead to decreased transmission and a decrease in the growth of the outbreak . Several methods exist for estimating these quantities either in real time as the epidemic progresses, or after the epidemic is over [2,3]. Frequently, these estimators assume a homogenously mixing population, even though often this simplifying assumption may not be realistic. One possible source of heterogeneity is the lack of spatial uniformity in transmission across the population in question. In such an instance, the question arises of how to modify our inference—on the reproductive number, for example—and the impact this might have on our understanding of transmission dynamics. Typically epidemiological studies of influenza report reproductive numbers over large geographic regions and populations, often estimating a reproductive number for an entire country [4,5]. This may be useful as a metric to compare to previous measures of the same quantity in an effort to determine relative transmissibility of a disease. However, this overall measure confounds information that may impact on transmissibility, or its measure, and it is likely not an insufficiently informative representation of the reproductive number."
PMC3916292,2014-02-06,Effect of the One-Child Policy on Influenza Transmission in China: A Stochastic Transmission Model," China's one-child-per-couple policy, introduced in 1979, led to profound demographic changes for nearly a quarter of the world's population. Several decades later, the consequences include decreased fertility rates, population aging, decreased household sizes, changes in family structure, and imbalanced sex ratios. The epidemiology of communicable diseases may have been affected by these changes since the transmission dynamics of infectious diseases depend on demographic characteristics of the population. Of particular interest is influenza because China and Southeast Asia lie at the center of a global transmission network of influenza. Moreover, changes in household structure may affect influenza transmission. Is it possible that the pronounced demographic changes that have occurred in China have affected influenza transmission? METHODS AND FINDINGS To address this question, we developed a continuous-time, stochastic, individual-based simulation model for influenza transmission. With this model, we simulated 30 years of influenza transmission and compared influenza transmission rates in populations with and without the one-child policy control. We found that the average annual attack rate is reduced by 6.08% (SD 2.21%) in the presence of the one-child policy compared to a population in which no demographic changes occurred. There was no discernible difference in the secondary attack rate, −0.15% (SD 1.85%), between the populations with and without a one-child policy. We also forecasted influenza transmission over a ten-year time period in a population with a two-child policy under a hypothesis that a two-child-per-couple policy will be carried out in 2015, and found a negligible difference in the average annual attack rate compared to the population with the one-child policy. CONCLUSIONS This study found that the average annual attack rate is slightly lowered in a population with a one-child policy, which may have resulted from a decrease in household size and the proportion of children in the population.","The one-child-per-couple policy in China was introduced in 1979 in an effort to raise living standards by slowing population growth. Subsequently, the policy reduced fertility rates ,  and household sizes, with only one dependent child found in most households. The total birth rate dropped from 2.90, before the policy was introduced, to 1.94 among women over 35 years of age, and to 1.73 among women under 35 years old in 2001. Women's preferences for smaller families have changed (35% prefer one child and 57% prefer two children according to a study in 2001) . The total fertility rate decreased from 2.9 in 1979 to 1.7 in 2004, with a rate of 1.3 in urban areas and less than 2.0 in rural areas. This trend has created a distinct demographic pattern for nearly a quarter of the world's population, resulting in Chinese urban families with predominantly one child and rural families with predominantly two children . The spread of infectious diseases may depend on demographic characteristics, environmental changes, consumption behaviors (eating, drinking, culinary culture, etc.), other behaviors (sexual contacts, drug use, hospital procedures, etc.), and host conditions (malnutrition, diabetes, immune status, etc.) . While the one child policy has had economic, demographic, and sociological ramifications far beyond the scope of infectious disease transmission, it is important to understand the consequences for influenza dynamics, in part because China and Southeast Asia lie at the center of a global transmission network of influenza . Demographic changes may affect influenza transmission dynamics because children have an increased susceptibility due to lower immunity. Moreover, increased viral shedding and longer infectious periods in children lead to more influenza among susceptible populations . Demographic characteristics have been incorporated into many modeling studies , ,  to help understand the effects on transmission of influenza or the socioeconomic impact of mitigation strategies , . Household composition is an important determinant of the transmission of respiratory pathogens including influenza , , , , , ,  and remains an important feature of recent transmission models , , , , , ."
PMC4050516,2014-03-14,Estimated Effects of Projected Climate Change on the Basic Reproductive Number of the Lyme Disease Vector Ixodes scapularis," The extent to which climate change may affect human health by increasing risk from vector-borne diseases has been under considerable debate. Objectives We quantified potential effects of future climate change on the basic reproduction number (R) of the tick vector of Lyme disease, Ixodes scapularis, and explored their importance for Lyme disease risk, and for vector-borne diseases in general. Methods We applied observed temperature data for North America and projected temperatures using regional climate models to drive an I. scapularis population model to hindcast recent, and project future, effects of climate warming on R. Modeled R increases were compared with R ranges for pathogens and parasites associated with variations in key ecological and epidemiological factors (obtained by literature review) to assess their epidemiological importance. Results R for I. scapularis in North America increased during the years 1971–2010 in spatio-temporal patterns consistent with observations. Increased temperatures due to projected climate change increased R by factors (2–5 times in Canada and 1.5–2 times in the United States), comparable to observed ranges of R for pathogens and parasites due to variations in strains, geographic locations, epidemics, host and vector densities, and control efforts. Conclusions Climate warming may have co-driven the emergence of Lyme disease in northeastern North America, and in the future may drive substantial disease spread into new geographic regions and increase tick-borne disease risk where climate is currently suitable. Our findings highlight the potential for climate change to have profound effects on vectors and vector-borne diseases, and the need to refocus efforts to understand these effects. Citation Ogden NH, Radojević M, Wu X, Duvvuri VR, Leighton PA, Wu J. 2014. Estimated effects of projected climate change on the basic reproductive number of the Lyme disease vector Ixodes scapularis. Environ Health Perspect 122631–638; ","Considerable attention has been devoted to the possibility that climate change will exacerbate the burden of mosquito-borne diseases such as malaria and dengue, with important impacts on public health (Githeko et al. 2000). Early assessments of the effects of climate change on malaria and dengue used simplistic models to assess possible effects of climate change on their basic reproductive numbers (R0, the universally recognized metric of the capacity of a parasite or pathogen to reproduce given particular environmental conditions) (Martens et al. 1995; Patz et al. 1998). However, these assessments were criticized for giving weight to future increases in R0 whether or not such increases resulted in R0 rising above the critical threshold of > 1 for disease persistence (Rogers and Randolph 2000) and for being oversimplistic by only accounting for climate effects rather than the full range of nonclimatic factors that impact the occurrence of these diseases (Reiter 2001; Rogers and Randolph 2000). Any impact of climate on R0 of malaria and dengue is limited by the effects of variations in human host density, mosquito control, infection prevention and treatment in humans, and human management of the environment (e.g., agriculture, forest management, logging) that affect the ecology and epidemiology of the vectors, pathogens, and diseases (Githeko et al. 2012). Consequently, the strength of evidence for recent climate warming effects on malaria risk has been questioned and much debated (Reiter et al. 2004; Tanser et al. 2003). Many vector-borne diseases of public health significance (e.g., Lyme disease, West Nile virus) are, however, maintained in transmission cycles that involve wild animal hosts. These cycles are independent of human cases, and the spatio-temporal risk of human disease is less dependent on the direct effects of human activities than is the risk from malaria and dengue. Nevertheless, despite some assessments (Gubler et al. 2001), the effects of climate change on vector-borne zoonoses have also been downplayed mostly on the basis of limited evidence for recent effects of climate change (Kilpatrick and Randolph 2012). Lyme disease emerged (or likely reemerged) in the northeastern United States in the late 1970s due to the expansion of tick populations, which was generally thought to have been associated with changes in land use over some decades that resulted in reforestation and expansion of the population of the deer that are key hosts for the ticks (Wood and Lafferty 2013). Lyme disease is now emerging in Canada and some northern U.S. states due to the northward expansion of the geographic range of the tick vector Ixodes scapularis (I. scapularis) (Hamer et al. 2010; Ogden et al. 2009), which is dispersed from source populations by migratory birds and terrestrial hosts (Leighton et al. 2012)."
PMC4130381,2014-05-19,"Evaluation of oseltamivir prophylaxis regimens for reducing influenza virus infection, transmission and disease severity in a ferret model of household contact","OBJECTIVES The emergence of the pandemic influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 virus in 2009 saw a significant increase in the therapeutic and prophylactic use of neuraminidase inhibitors (NAIs) to mitigate the impact of this highly transmissible virus. Prior to the pandemic, many countries stockpiled NAIs and developed pandemic plans for the use of antiviral drugs, based on either treatment of high-risk individuals and/or prophylaxis of contacts. However, to date there has been a lack of in vivo models to test the efficacy of treatment or prophylaxis with NAIs, for influenza-infected individuals or exposed contacts, in a household setting. METHODS A ferret model of household contact was developed to study the efficacy of different prophylaxis regimens in preventing infection in contact ferrets exposed to influenza A(H1N1)pdm09-infected index ferrets. RESULTS Among the different prophylactic regimens, contact ferrets receiving oseltamivir prophylaxis twice daily showed better outcomes than those receiving oseltamivir once daily. Benefits included a significant delay in the time to secondary infection, lower weight loss and higher activity levels. The treatment of index ferrets at 36 h post-infection did not influence either secondary infection rates or clinical symptoms in exposed contact ferrets. Neither prophylaxis nor treatment prevented infection or reduced the duration of viral shedding, although clinical symptoms did improve in infected animals receiving prophylaxis. CONCLUSIONS Different oseltamivir prophylaxis regimens did not prevent infections, but consistently resulted in a reduction in symptoms in infected ferrets. However, oseltamivir prophylaxis failed to reduce viral titres, which warrants further investigation in humans.","The prophylactic and/or therapeutic management of seasonal influenza currently relies solely on the neuraminidase (NA) inhibitors (NAIs) due to resistance of circulating influenza A viruses to the older adamantane class of antivirals.1,2 The most widely prescribed NAI is oseltamivir (Tamiflu™), followed by zanamivir (Relenza™), although other new NAIs, such as laninamivir and peramivir, have recently been approved for use in Japan, South Korea and China.3,4 Many countries have stockpiled antiviral drugs, particularly oseltamivir, in preparedness for a future influenza pandemic. For seasonal influenza, pre-exposure prophylaxis with NAIs has been shown to be effective in preventing the development of symptomatic infection in household contacts.5,6 Likewise, post-exposure prophylaxis with NAIs has also been effective in reducing the spread of infection in household contacts and communities.7,8 The emergence of the pandemic A(H1N1)pdm09 influenza virus in March–April 2009 resulted in a significant increase in the global use of NAIs for the treatment and prevention of infection.9 Early NAI treatment of infected individuals or patients displaying influenza-like symptoms was associated with reductions in both severe clinical outcomes and mortality during the 2009 pandemic.10 In addition, post-exposure oseltamivir prophylaxis was effective in reducing the rate of A(H1N1)pdm09 viral infections in households11 and closed institutional settings such as military camps.12 However, the therapeutic and prophylactic effectiveness of oseltamivir against mild seasonal influenza infections has been questioned following a meta-analysis of clinical trial data.13 Prior to the 2009 pandemic, countries proposed different strategies for the use of antivirals. Australia's pandemic plan recommended liberal antiviral distribution for prophylaxis to limit the spread of infection and buy time for vaccine development,14 but other countries, such as the USA, focused on the use of NAIs for case treatment.15 The development of guidelines on the appropriate use of NAIs relies on antiviral effectiveness data derived largely from field epidemiological studies or clinical studies. However, these data may be limited or not available for newly emerged strains, which could differ in virulence and transmissibility from seasonal influenza viruses. Animal studies of NAI effectiveness, which have the advantage of being more rapidly established than human studies, have the potential to provide early data on the effectiveness of an NAI against a newly emerged influenza virus. Consequently, an in vivo model to test the effectiveness of different antiviral treatment or prophylaxis regimens on influenza infection and transmission in a household setting is needed."

In this scenario, we investigate the temporal evolution and current status of the AIDS epidemic in Brazil. Specifically, we analyze records of annual absolute frequency of cases for more than 5000 cities for the first 33 years of the infection in Brazil. We found that (i) the annual absolute frequencies exhibit a logistic-type growth with an exponential regime in the first few years of the AIDS spreading; (ii) the actual reproduction number decaying as a power law; (iii) the distribution of the annual absolute frequencies among cities decays with a power law behavior; (iv) the annual absolute frequencies and the number of inhabitants have an allometric relationship; (v) the temporal evolution of the annual absolute frequencies have different profile depending on the average annual absolute frequencies in the cities. These findings yield a general quantitative description of the AIDS infection dynamics in Brazil since the beginning. They also provide clues about the effectiveness of treatment and control programs against the infection, that has had a different impact depending on the number of inhabitants of cities. In this framework, our results give insights into the overall dynamics of AIDS epidemic, which may contribute to select empirically accurate models.","The spreading of epidemics is a threat to the world public health. It has also been arising large scientific attention due to the potential harm to the society –. In particular, the infection by the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) — which causes AIDS — has been the subject of intense studies since the early 1980s, when the virus started spreading quickly throughout the globe and has become a worldwide concern –. Estimates reveal that by the end of 2010 more than 30 million people were living with the infection worldwide. As a comparison, about 2.7 million new infections were identified on the globe just in 2010 ,. The study of the epidemiology of HIV infection using accurate surveillance data has been providing essential information in guiding rational control and intervention programs, as well as in monitoring trends of the epidemic in many countries ,,–,–. For example, it has been shown that new HIV infections among adults depend on their geographic region in the globe and social contact groups distributions . Brazil — the world's fifth most populous country, with almost 200 million inhabitants — was the first developing country to implement a large-scale control and intervention programs , . The Brazilian response to AIDS has included effective prevention strategies with strong participation of the civil society, multi-sectoral mobilization, and intense use of antiretroviral therapies , . In a global scenario, these facts has attracted significant attention from the scientific community to the dynamics of HIV/AIDS epidemic in Brazil , ."
PMC4288732,2015-01-08,Using Modelling to Disentangle the Relative Contributions of Zoonotic and Anthroponotic Transmission: The Case of Lassa Fever," Zoonotic infections, which transmit from animals to humans, form the majority of new human pathogens. Following zoonotic transmission, the pathogen may already have, or may acquire, the ability to transmit from human to human. With infections such as Lassa fever (LF), an often fatal, rodent-borne, hemorrhagic fever common in areas of West Africa, rodent-to-rodent, rodent-to-human, human-to-human and even human-to-rodent transmission patterns are possible. Indeed, large hospital-related outbreaks have been reported. Estimating the proportion of transmission due to human-to-human routes and related patterns (e.g. existence of super-spreaders), in these scenarios is challenging, but essential for planned interventions. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS Here, we make use of an innovative modeling approach to analyze data from published outbreaks and the number of LF hospitalized patients to Kenema Government Hospital in Sierra Leone to estimate the likely contribution of human-to-human transmission. The analyses show that almost [Image see text] of the cases at KGH are secondary cases arising from human-to-human transmission. However, we found much of this transmission is associated with a disproportionally large impact of a few individuals (‘super-spreaders’), as we found only [Image see text] of human cases result in an effective reproduction number (i.e. the average number of secondary cases per infectious case) [Image see text], with a maximum value up to [Image see text]. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE This work explains the discrepancy between the sizes of reported LF outbreaks and a clinical perception that human-to-human transmission is low. Future assessment of risks of LF and infection control guidelines should take into account the potentially large impact of super-spreaders in human-to-human transmission. Our work highlights several neglected topics in LF research, the occurrence and nature of super-spreading events and aspects of social behavior in transmission and detection.","Diseases at the animal-human interface are in general subjected to different modes of cross-species transmission animal-to-animal, animal-to-human, human-to-human and even human-to-animal. Estimating the relative contribution of each is of fundamental importance for the planning and implementation of appropriate infection control and preventive measures. This can be an extremely difficult task if humans and animals share the same physical space, and/or if experimentation (e.g. to quantify the probability of animal-to-animal transmission) is subjected to serious limitations. This is the case of Lassa fever (LF), a rodent-borne disease endemic in West Africa. Despite its clear zoonotic origin, there are strong arguments, listed below, to hypothesize that a significant proportion of the burden of LF in humans arises from human-to-human transmission. The aim of this work is to test whether or not patterns in the epidemic curve describing the cases of LF observed in Sierra Leone , are compatible with patterns observed in chains of pure human-to-human transmission recorded in nosocomial and extra-nosocomial outbreaks , . Lassa fever is an acute, viral hemorrhagic disease caused by Lassa fever virus (LASV), an enveloped RNA virus of the Arenaviridae. The disease was first recognized in the village of Lassa, Nigeria in 1969, which caused the death of two missionary-nurses and the grave illness of a third . However, cases consistent with LF from the eastern part of Sierra Leone can be traced back to 
. Since the identification of LASV, human-to-human transmission has been documented in several nosocomial outbreaks (e.g.
,  and also  for a review), leading to an initial perception that the virus was both highly contagious and virulent ; this resulted in stringent requirements for containment of the patients . Soon after, its zoonotic origin was recognized and Mastomys natalensis, one of the most common African rodents, was identified as the reservoir of the virus . The risk of nosocomial transmission was shown to be dramatically reduced by using simple barrier nursing method , –, suggesting that the risk of human-to-human transmission might be negligible."

Emergence of infectious diseases like influenza pandemic (H1N1) 2009 has become great concern, which posed new challenges to the health authorities worldwide. To control these diseases various studies have been developed in the field of mathematical modelling, which is useful tool for understanding the epidemiological dynamics and their dependence on social mixing patterns. Method. We have used Bayesian approach to quantify the disease outbreak through key epidemiological parameter basic reproduction number (R ), using effective contacts, defined as sum of the product of incidence cases and probability of generation time distribution. We have estimated R  from daily case incidence data for pandemic influenza A/H1N1 2009 in India, for the initial phase. Result. The estimated R  with 95% credible interval is consistent with several other studies on the same strain. Through sensitivity analysis our study indicates that infectiousness affects the estimate of R . Conclusion. Basic reproduction number R  provides the useful information to the public health system to do some effort in controlling the disease by using mitigation strategies like vaccination, quarantine, and so forth.","Influenza is an emerging infectious disease and influenza-like illness (ILI) is a clinical illness caused by the influenza virus, which gave rise to human pandemics such as 1918 Spanish flu (H1N1), 1957 Asian flu (H3N2), 1968 Hong Kong flu (H2N2), and most recently H1N1 pandemic 2009. Influenza A (H1N1) was originally referred to as “swine flu” because laboratory testing showed that many of the genes in this new virus were very similar to those found in pigs in North America. Further on, it has been found that this new virus has gene segments from the swine, avian, and human flu virus genes. The scientists call this a “quadruple reassortant” virus and hence this new (novel) virus is christened “influenza-A (H1N1) virus” . A reassorted influenza was first detected in Mexico on March 18, 2009, and rapidly spread to the United States, Canada, and subsequently all regions worldwide including India. The first case of H1N1 was reported in India on May 17, 2009, at Hyderabad Airport in a young boy who travelled from the USA and later it spread throughout the country . According to World Health Organization (WHO) update of November 20, 2009, virus spread across more than 206 countries resulting in 6770 deaths . In June 2009 World Health Organization (WHO) raised the level of pandemic alert phase 5 to phase 6 . According to the Directorate General of Health Services, Government of India, New Delhi, update on November 19, 2009, there have been 16044 laboratories confirming cases recorded in India resulting in 537 deaths ."
PMC4438980,2015-05-20,"Widespread Recombination, Reassortment, and Transmission of Unbalanced Compound Viral Genotypes in Natural Arenavirus Infections","Arenaviruses are one of the largest families of human hemorrhagic fever viruses and are known to infect both mammals and snakes. Arenaviruses package a large (L) and small (S) genome segment in their virions. For segmented RNA viruses like these, novel genotypes can be generated through mutation, recombination, and reassortment. Although it is believed that an ancient recombination event led to the emergence of a new lineage of mammalian arenaviruses, neither recombination nor reassortment has been definitively documented in natural arenavirus infections. Here, we used metagenomic sequencing to survey the viral diversity present in captive arenavirus-infected snakes. From 48 infected animals, we determined the complete or near complete sequence of 210 genome segments that grouped into 23 L and 11 S genotypes. The majority of snakes were multiply infected, with up to 4 distinct S and 11 distinct L segment genotypes in individual animals. This S/L imbalance was typical in all cases intrahost L segment genotypes outnumbered S genotypes, and a particular S segment genotype dominated in individual animals and at a population level. We corroborated sequencing results by qRT-PCR and virus isolation, and isolates replicated as ensembles in culture. Numerous instances of recombination and reassortment were detected, including recombinant segments with unusual organizations featuring 2 intergenic regions and superfluous content, which were capable of stable replication and transmission despite their atypical structures. Overall, this represents intrahost diversity of an extent and form that goes well beyond what has been observed for arenaviruses or for viruses in general. This diversity can be plausibly attributed to the captive intermingling of sub-clinically infected wild-caught snakes. Thus, beyond providing a unique opportunity to study arenavirus evolution and adaptation, these findings allow the investigation of unintended anthropogenic impacts on viral ecology, diversity, and disease potential.","Several mechanisms generate viral genetic diversity [1–3]. All work by producing populations of viral genomes, a small fraction of which may exhibit an adaptive advantage in a new host species, different tissue, or in the face of drug or immune pressure. Replication of RNA viral genomes by error-prone polymerases results in relatively high mutation frequencies, and RNA viruses replicate as collections of closely related variant genotypes [2,4–7]. Viral genomes can shed content or acquire new loci from their hosts by horizontal gene transfer. In coinfected cells, recombination between different viral strains or species can produce chimeric progeny [8–11]. And in cells coinfected by segmented viruses, reassortment generates virions containing shuffled mixtures of segments from the parental genotypes [11,12]. Understanding basic mechanisms of viral adaptation is essential in order to better combat, prevent, and predict viral diseases. For example, the ability of pandemic influenza virus strains to efficiently replicate in and be transmitted between humans frequently results from de novo mutation and reassortment . The continuous emergence of drug-resistant genotypes is a major hindrance to the effective treatment of human immunodeficiency virus-1 and other pathogens [14,15]. And, recombination between individually attenuated strains present in the oral poliovirus vaccine results in neuropathic progeny strains, and complicates eradication efforts ."
PMC4477231,2015-06-23,Ionizing air affects influenza virus infectivity and prevents airborne-transmission,"By the use of a modified ionizer device we describe effective prevention of airborne transmitted influenza A (strain Panama 99) virus infection between animals and inactivation of virus (>97%). Active ionizer prevented 100% (4/4) of guinea pigs from infection. Moreover, the device effectively captured airborne transmitted calicivirus, rotavirus and influenza virus, with recovery rates up to 21% after 40 min in a 19 m room. The ionizer generates negative ions, rendering airborne particles/aerosol droplets negatively charged and electrostatically attracts them to a positively charged collector plate. Trapped viruses are then identified by reverse transcription quantitative real-time PCR. The device enables unique possibilities for rapid and simple removal of virus from air and offers possibilities to simultaneously identify and prevent airborne transmission of viruses.","To develop and validate the ionizing technique for collection and identification of viral pathogens, we used several viruses of clinical importance; calicivirus, rotavirus and influenza virus (H3N2, strain Salomon Island) as well as latex particles. Canine calicivirus (CaCV, strain 48) was used as a surrogate27 for human norovirus, the aetiological agent behind the “winter vomiting disease”, causing outbreaks of great clinical and economic importance28. Rhesus rotavirus was used as a surrogate marker for human rotavirus29. The device (Fig. 1a) consists of a small portable 12 volt operated ionizer, with a collector plate of positive charge attached to the ionizer, attracting negative particles from the air by electrostatic attraction. To determine optimal time collection parameters, latex particles with sizes ranging from <1 to >10 μm were nebulized into a room of 19 m3. Testing revealed that 40–60 min was required to eliminate >90% of free latex particles in the air as determined by real-time particle counting (PortaCount Plus). The particle counter can detect particles with size greater than 0.02 μM. Visualization by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) on grids from active- and inactive ionizer collector plates showed that accumulation of latex particles was dramatically enhanced on active ionizer collector plates compared to the inactive (Fig. 1b,c). Next, high numbers of rotavirus and formalin-inactivated influenza virus were aerosolized under the same conditions. While, after 40 min the inactive collector plates contained few (<5) rotavirus and influenza virus, the active collector contained >50 virus particles, as determined by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), (Fig. 1d,e)."
PMC4528592,2015-07-06,The role of heterogeneity in contact timing and duration in network models of influenza spread in schools,"Influenza poses a significant health threat to children, and schools may play a critical role in community outbreaks. Mathematical outbreak models require assumptions about contact rates and patterns among students, but the level of temporal granularity required to produce reliable results is unclear. We collected objective contact data from students aged 5–14 at an elementary school and middle school in the state of Utah, USA, and paired those data with a novel, data-based model of influenza transmission in schools. Our simulations produced within-school transmission averages consistent with published estimates. We compared simulated outbreaks over the full resolution dynamic network with simulations on networks with averaged representations of contact timing and duration. For both schools, averaging the timing of contacts over one or two school days caused average outbreak sizes to increase by 1–8%. Averaging both contact timing and pairwise contact durations caused average outbreak sizes to increase by 10% at the middle school and 72% at the elementary school. Averaging contact durations separately across within-class and between-class contacts reduced the increase for the elementary school to 5%. Thus, the effect of ignoring details about contact timing and duration in school contact networks on outbreak size modelling can vary across different schools.","School-age children bear a significant burden of illness caused by influenza infection [1,2]. High rates of transmission among students may also pose direct risk to family contacts  and indirect risk to their larger community . Quantifying transmission-relevant contacts among children at schools is an important component of mathematical transmission models and simulations. These in turn serve to clarify the role that schools play in community transmission and the potential effects of school closures or other school-based interventions in reducing transmission. Influenza virus can be transmitted via three route categories (i) large droplets expelled by an infectious person through coughing, sneezing or talking directly into the eyes, nose or mouth of a susceptible person; (ii) smaller, aerosolized particles inhaled by a susceptible person; and (iii) hand-to-face self-inoculation after touching a contaminated person, surface or object . Specific scenarios within each category involve an infectious and susceptible pair being in simultaneous, close proximity. Large droplets travel only short distances, typically 6 feet or less . Aerosolized particles can travel further, but a recent study found that detected amounts of influenza-carrying small particles emitted by infected hospital patients dropped significantly at a distance of 6 feet from the patients, compared with closer distances . Finally, hand contamination via direct touching or object passing requires proximity within arm's reach. Therefore, while the relative importance of transmission modes or particular scenarios remains unclear, contacts within close proximity (approximately 6 feet or 2 metres) are thought to be highly relevant to influenza transmission."
PMC4570805,2015-09-15,Early real-time estimation of the basic reproduction number of emerging or reemerging infectious diseases in a community with heterogeneous contact pattern: Using data from Hong Kong 2009 H1N1 Pandemic Influenza as an illustrative example,"Emerging and re-emerging infections such as SARS  and pandemic H1N1  have caused concern for public health researchers and policy makers due to the increased burden of these diseases on health care systems. This concern has prompted the use of mathematical models to evaluate strategies to control disease spread, making these models invaluable tools to identify optimal intervention strategies. A particularly important quantity in infectious disease epidemiology is the basic reproduction number, R(0.) Estimation of this quantity is crucial for effective control responses in the early phase of an epidemic. In our previous study, an approach for estimating the basic reproduction number in real time was developed. This approach uses case notification data and the structure of potential transmission contacts to accurately estimate R from the limited amount of information available at the early stage of an outbreak. Based on this approach, we extend the existing methodology; the most recent method features intra- and inter-age groups contact heterogeneity. Given the number of newly reported cases at the early stage of the outbreak, with parsimony assumptions on removal distribution and infectivity profile of the diseases, experiments to estimate real time R under different levels of intra- and inter-group contact heterogeneity using two age groups are presented. We show that the new method converges more quickly to the actual value of R than the previous one, in particular when there is high-level intra-group and inter-group contact heterogeneity. With the age specific contact patterns, number of newly reported cases, removal distribution, and information about the natural history of the 2009 pandemic influenza in Hong Kong, we also use the extended model to estimate R and age-specific R.","The emergence and global spread of a novel H1N1 influenza A virus (pH1N1) in early 2009 presented a number of new challenges to policy makers and epidemiologists . In the early phases of the epidemic, with limited information on the number of infections, policy makers tried to mitigate disease spread as best they could. Mathematical modeling of infectious disease has made increasing contributions to public health decisions    with the aim of estimating the basic reproduction number, R0 . R0 is defined as the number of secondary cases generated by one infectious individual during his/her entire infection period in a totally susceptible population . When R0 is greater than one, there is a likelihood that the infection will to continue to spread; however if R0 is less than one, then the infection will eventually die out. For this reason, estimating the basic reproduction number is paramount for assessing the effectiveness of different intervention strategies. Most classical mathematical models of infectious disease transmission, also known as compartmental models, assume homogeneous mixing among individuals. In other words, each individual has an equal chance of infecting others in a population. However, the estimates of R0 from models with this parsimonious assumption may differ greatly from models featuring heterogeneous contacts patterns, resulting in different epidemiological outcomes under the same intervention policies . Studies have suggested that many infectious diseases exhibit heterogeneity in transmission efficiency in certain individuals (for example “super-spreaders” in SARS ), or in specific groups of individuals that appear to account for most of the transmission (such as school age children in H1N1 influenza A )  . To ensure that this heterogeneity is modeled, contact network models are used to explicitly capture patterns of disease transmission. Contact network models can also be used to compare the intervention strategies for different infectious diseases when epidemiological data are limited, as was the case with SARS in 2003 and H1N1 pandemic influenza virus in 2009  ."
PMC4574436,2015-09-16,Survey of Ixodes pacificus Ticks in California Reveals a Diversity of Microorganisms and a Novel and Widespread Anaplasmataceae Species,"Ixodes pacificus ticks can harbor a wide range of human and animal pathogens. To survey the prevalence of tick-borne known and putative pathogens, we tested 982 individual adult and nymphal I. pacificus ticks collected throughout California between 2007 and 2009 using a broad-range PCR and electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (PCR/ESI-MS) assay designed to detect a wide range of tick-borne microorganisms. Overall, 1.4% of the ticks were found to be infected with Borrelia burgdorferi, 2.0% were infected with Borrelia miyamotoi and 0.3% were infected with Anaplasma phagocytophilum. In addition, 3.0% were infected with Babesia odocoilei. About 1.2% of the ticks were co-infected with more than one pathogen or putative pathogen. In addition, we identified a novel Anaplasmataceae species that we characterized by sequencing of its 16S rRNA, groEL, gltA, and rpoB genes. Sequence analysis indicated that this organism is phylogenetically distinct from known Anaplasma species with its closest genetic near neighbors coming from Asia. The prevalence of this novel Anaplasmataceae species was as high as 21% at one site, and it was detected in 4.9% of ticks tested statewide. Based upon this genetic characterization we propose that this organism be called ‘Candidatus Cryptoplasma californiense’. Knowledge of this novel microbe will provide awareness for the community about the breadth of the I. pacificus microbiome, the concept that this bacterium could be more widely spread; and an opportunity to explore whether this bacterium also contributes to human or animal disease burden.","In the western United States Ixodes pacificus ticks are the vector of Borrelia burgdorferi, the causative agent of Lyme disease [1,2]. I. pacificus ticks are also vectors for several other vector-borne pathogens including Borrelia miyamotoi and Anaplasma phagocytophilum. In addition, I. pacificus ticks have been shown to carry Spiroplasma ixodetis , a microorganism that has no known role in human disease. Broad-range PCR and electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (PCR/ESI-MS) can detect multiple pathogens in a single test including tick-borne pathogens [4–14]. PCR/ESI-MS can also detect novel and uncharacterized organisms [10,12,15–19]. We have previously used PCR/ESI-MS to characterize a large collection of ticks, including I. pacificus ticks from California, for the prevalence of B. miyamotoi . Most studies of I. pacificus ticks have employed tests designed to detect single pathogens and not co-infections. In this study we used PCR/ESI-MS to characterize the breadth of microorganisms carried by I. pacificus collected from throughout the state of California. In the ticks analyzed, we detected several previously described endemic zoonotic pathogens as well as Babesia odocoilei, a protozoan not previously known to be carried by I. pacificus. Many of the microbes carried by ticks are obligate intracellular microbes and have not been cultured but have been identified and characterized genetically such as ‘Candidatus Rickettsia andeanae’, ‘Candidatus Rickettsia vini’ and ‘Candidatus Neoehrlichia mikurensis' [20–23]. In our study we identified and genetically characterized a novel and widespread Anaplasmataceae species which is genetically most closely related to isolates from Asia. Broad-range PCR employs PCR primers designed to generate an amplicon from a wide range of microbes. Depending upon the organism(s) present in the sample the resulting amplicons will be comprised of differing composition of bases (the number of A’s, G’s, C’s and T’s aka base count). When these amplicons are analyzed by electrospray ionization mass spectrometry the base count of the amplicons can be determined and compared to a database to identify the organism(s) present. Nucleic acid extracts from ticks were screened for tick-borne microorganisms with three variations of a broad-range PCR/ESI-MS assay (Table 1). Primer set A includes 16 primer pairs designed to detect and identify a wide and diverse range of bacterial species. Primer set B includes two primer pairs designed to detect all Babesia species . Primer set C consists of nine primer pairs designed to detect a wide range of bacterial and protozoan tick-borne pathogens that were previously described . PCR amplicons were analyzed by electrospray ionization followed by time of flight mass spectrometry system (Abbott Laboratories, Des Plaines IL) as previously described [10,13,14,24–27]."
PMC4626779,2015-10-30,Modeling the effect of comprehensive interventions on Ebola virus transmission,"Since the re-emergence of Ebola in West Africa in 2014, comprehensive and stringent interventions have been implemented to decelerate the spread of the disease. The effectiveness of interventions still remains unclear. In this paper, we develop an epidemiological model that includes various controlling measures to systematically evaluate their effects on the disease transmission dynamics. By fitting the model to reported cumulative cases and deaths in Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia until March 22, 2015, we estimate the basic reproduction number in these countries as 1.2552, 1.6093 and 1.7994, respectively. Model analysis shows that there exists a threshold of the effectiveness of isolation, below which increasing the fraction of latent individuals diagnosed prior to symptoms onset or shortening the duration between symptoms onset and isolation may lead to more Ebola infection. This challenges an existing view. Media coverage plays a substantial role in reducing the final epidemic size. The response to reported cumulative infected cases and deaths may have a different effect on the epidemic spread in different countries. Among all the interventions, we find that shortening the duration between death and burial and improving the effectiveness of isolation are two effective interventions for controlling the outbreak of Ebola virus infection.","We develop a mathematical model (Eq. 1) to study the impact of comprehensive interventions including isolation, media impact, safe burial and vaccination. The population is divided into eight classes S (susceptible individuals who can be infected by Ebola virus following a contact with infectious cases), V (vaccinated individuals), E1 (latent undetectable individuals), E2 (latent detectable individuals), I (infectious individuals with symptoms), J (isolated individuals), D (individuals who are dead but have not been buried; they can still transmit the disease during funerals), and R (recovered individuals). Let N denote the total population size, i.e., N = S + V + E1 + E2 + I + J + R. Susceptible individuals become infected through contact with infectious individuals and enter into the latent class at rate , where β is the mean human-to-human transmission rate per day,  quantifies the relative transmissibility of isolated individuals compared to infectious symptomatic patients who are not isolated. Therefore,  (reduction in transmissibility) provides a measure of the effectiveness of isolation. βD is the transmission rate during funerals. In the model, , , where CI and CD are the cumulative infected cases and deaths, respectively. m1 and m2 are non-negative parameters that measure the effect of media reported cumulative numbers of infected cases and deaths on the contact transmission. When mi (i = 1, 2) is 0 or relatively small, the transmission rate β is equal or close to the constant β1. For mi > 0, the public is more aware of the disease so that the transmission rate could be decreased to β0 (<β1) as the number of accumulated infected cases CI or deaths CD increases. Similarly, the transmission rate βD0 is assumed to be less than βD1 during funerals."
PMC4629279,2015-11-03,"Ebola virus disease in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, 1976-2014","The Democratic Republic of the Congo has experienced the most outbreaks of Ebola virus disease since the virus' discovery in 1976. This article provides for the first time a description and a line list for all outbreaks in this country, comprising 996 cases. Compared to patients over 15 years old, the odds of dying were significantly lower in patients aged 5 to 15 and higher in children under five (with 100% mortality in those under 2 years old). The odds of dying increased by 11% per day that a patient was not hospitalised. Outbreaks with an initially high reproduction number, R (>3), were rapidly brought under control, whilst outbreaks with a lower initial R caused longer and generally larger outbreaks. These findings can inform the choice of target age groups for interventions and highlight the importance of both reducing the delay between symptom onset and hospitalisation and rapid national and international response. DOI ","Ebola virus disease (EVD) outbreaks are rare and knowledge of the transmission and clinical features of this disease is sparse. As of May 2015, the devastating outbreak in West Africa has resulted in more than ten times the number of cases reported in all previous outbreaks and will ultimately provide improved insights into EVD. Here, for the first time, all the databases from EVD outbreaks in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) have been cleaned and compiled into one anonymised individual-level dataset (See Supplementary file 1). The data provided are an invaluable addition to the West Africa data and will allow a more complete picture of the disease. The DRC is the country that has experienced the most outbreaks of EVD. Since the virus' discovery in 1976, there have been six major outbreaks (Yambuku 1976, Kikwit 1995, Mweka 2007, Mweka 2008/2009, Isiro 2012, and Boende 2014) and one minor outbreak (Tandala 1977) reported in the DRC, four in the northern Equateur and Orientale provinces and three in the southern provinces of Bandundu and Kasai-Occidental (Figure 1). Some of these have been described in the literature (World Health Organization, 1978; Heymann et al., 1980; Khan et al., 1999; Muyembe-Tamfum et al., 1999, 2012; Maganga et al., 2014). However, the individual-level data and corresponding lessons from these outbreaks have not been collated or made publicly available; by doing so, we aim to permit a more powerful statistical analysis and a fuller understanding of the disease. The end of the most recent outbreak in the DRC was declared on the 21st of November 2014. This provides an unparalleled opportunity to assemble all the information gathered about EVD in the DRC through almost four decades, learn from the Congolese experience with this disease, and compare the features of EVD in DRC with the epidemic that has had such a devastating effect in West Africa. The number of cases and case-fatality ratios (CFRs) varied greatly between outbreaks (Table 2). It can also be observed that laboratory confirmation became more readily available over time. Across all outbreaks, 57% of cases were female (95% CI = 53.9–60.1). In the second Mweka outbreak and in the Isiro outbreak, more than 70% of cases were females. However, in the other outbreaks, the percentage of females was lower (53–59%). When comparing the probable and confirmed cases by age with the overall DRC population (Figure 2), we observed a high concentration of cases in the 25–64 age category compared to the baseline population. This might be because at this age individuals are more likely to be carers. The occupation was only recorded during three outbreaks Kikwit, Boende and Isiro. During Kikwit, 23% (73/317) of cases were known healthcare workers (HCWs) and 0.6% (2/317) were possible HCWs. During Boende, the occupation was recorded for 85% (58/68) of cases. 14%  were known HCWs and 3%  were possible HCWs. During Isiro, occupation was reported for 94% (49/52) of cases. 27%  were HCW. Although occupation was not recorded on an individual level, during Yambuku, 13 of the 17 Yambuku Hospital workers contracted EVD (World Health Organization, 1978)."
PMC4631366,2015-11-03,Dispersion of the HIV-1 Epidemic in Men Who Have Sex with Men in the Netherlands: A Combined Mathematical Model and Phylogenetic Analysis," The HIV-1 subtype B epidemic amongst men who have sex with men (MSM) is resurgent in many countries despite the widespread use of effective combination antiretroviral therapy (cART). In this combined mathematical and phylogenetic study of observational data, we aimed to find out the extent to which the resurgent epidemic is the result of newly introduced strains or of growth of already circulating strains. METHODS AND FINDINGS As of November 2011, the ATHENA observational HIV cohort of all patients in care in the Netherlands since 1996 included HIV-1 subtype B polymerase sequences from 5,852 patients. Patients who were diagnosed between 1981 and 1995 were included in the cohort if they were still alive in 1996. The ten most similar sequences to each ATHENA sequence were selected from the Los Alamos HIV Sequence Database, and a phylogenetic tree was created of a total of 8,320 sequences. Large transmission clusters that included ≥10 ATHENA sequences were selected, with a local support value ≥ 0.9 and median pairwise patristic distance below the fifth percentile of distances in the whole tree. Time-varying reproduction numbers of the large MSM-majority clusters were estimated through mathematical modeling. We identified 106 large transmission clusters, including 3,061 (52%) ATHENA and 652 Los Alamos sequences. Half of the HIV sequences from MSM registered in the cohort in the Netherlands (2,128 of 4,288) were included in 91 large MSM-majority clusters. Strikingly, at least 54 (59%) of these 91 MSM-majority clusters were already circulating before 1996, when cART was introduced, and have persisted to the present. Overall, 1,226 (35%) of the 3,460 diagnoses among MSM since 1996 were found in these 54 long-standing clusters. The reproduction numbers of all large MSM-majority clusters were around the epidemic threshold value of one over the whole study period. A tendency towards higher numbers was visible in recent years, especially in the more recently introduced clusters. The mean age of MSM at diagnosis increased by 0.45 years/year within clusters, but new clusters appeared with lower mean age. Major strengths of this study are the high proportion of HIV-positive MSM with a sequence in this study and the combined application of phylogenetic and modeling approaches. Main limitations are the assumption that the sampled population is representative of the overall HIV-positive population and the assumption that the diagnosis interval distribution is similar between clusters. CONCLUSIONS The resurgent HIV epidemic amongst MSM in the Netherlands is driven by several large, persistent, self-sustaining, and, in many cases, growing sub-epidemics shifting towards new generations of MSM. Many of the sub-epidemics have been present since the early epidemic, to which new sub-epidemics are being added.","The HIV-1 epidemic amongst men who have sex with men (MSM) is resurgent in many Western countries [1–5]. This may seem paradoxical, as HIV-positive men are being diagnosed at an increasingly earlier stage of HIV infection, and, since 1996, most diagnosed men take effective combination antiretroviral therapy (cART). Not only does successful therapy halt disease progression , but successful suppression of virus replication also reduces the risk of transmitting HIV [7,8]. With the introduction of cART, however, there has been an increase in unprotected sex in many countries. For the Netherlands, this was first demonstrated using a mathematical model that included disease progression to analyze national data from the ATHENA cohort on HIV and AIDS diagnoses and treatment success and failure [1,2]. These findings were later confirmed by analysis of behavioral data from the Amsterdam Cohort Studies, which found that sexual risk behavior increased in a manner similar to model predictions [9,10]. The resulting reproduction number for the epidemic amongst MSM was estimated to be around the epidemic threshold of one . In the period 2007–2010, 2,928 new HIV diagnoses were registered amongst MSM in the Netherlands, very similar to earlier predictions assuming no reductions in risk behavior . In the current study, we aimed to gain more insight into the transmission clusters that constitute this mainly HIV-1 subtype B epidemic amongst MSM over time . Similarly to an earlier Swiss study, we used phylogenetic analysis of extensive HIV-1 subtype B polymerase (pol) sequence data to identify large transmission clusters . The authors of the Swiss study subsequently estimated a reproduction number for each sub-epidemic directly from the sequence data [13,14]. Here, we also analyze the viral transmission dynamics over time within the different clusters. However, we applied a mathematical model to the estimated incidence of diagnoses within each cluster, using the distribution of time between diagnoses of index cases and secondary cases derived from a previous study [2,15]. Our analysis estimates the time-varying reproduction numbers of the large MSM-majority clusters that together drive the overall dynamics of the epidemic. This will clarify the extent to which the resurgent epidemic is the result of newly introduced strains or of growth of already circulating strains."
PMC4634238,2013-08-30,Evidence of transmission and risk factors for influenza A virus in household dogs and their owners," The possible transmission of influenza A virus between dogs and humans is important, as in Mexico City there are approximately 1·2 million dogs. We present the first evidence of influenza A virus infection in household dogs in Mexico. OBJECTIVES The objective of this study was to identify the presence of antibodies against influenza A virus in dogs and their owners, as well as the presence of RNA of influenza A virus in nasal exudates of dogs and, thereby, assess the possible transmission of the virus between humans and dogs. METHODS Serum samples from household dogs and their owners were analyzed to detect the presence of antibodies against three subtypes of human influenza virus (H1N1pdm09, H1N1, and H3N2), as well as subtype H3N8 of equine influenza. We analyzed dog nasal exudates to detect influenza viral RNA. The relationship between the seropositivity of dogs and various factors (age, sex, constantly at home, and seropositivity of owners) was statistically analyzed. RESULTS Seroprevalence for human influenza in dogs was 0·9% (1 of 113), and it was 4% (5 of 113) for equine influenza. In humans, seroprevalence was 22% for subtype H1N1pdm09, 20% for subtype H1N1, and 11% for subtype H3N2. No significant association (P > 0·05) was found between seropositivity and any of the assessed factors. Furthermore, no viral RNA was detected in the nasal exudate samples. CONCLUSIONS Results revealed seroprevalence of the influenza virus in household dogs in Mexico City. It can be assumed that dogs are currently becoming infected with different subtypes of influenza viruses.","The constant evolution of the influenza virus favors genetic variability and transmission to other species. Interspecies transmission of influenza viruses is a difficult process because there are barriers that hinder infection; however, diverse factors such as population growth and consumption habits have reduced these barriers by increasing contact among species.1 Antigenic drift and antigenic shift generate structural changes in the virus and allow evolution and variability,2 thereby encouraging infection and adaptation in different animal species.3 The clinical disease associated with the influenza virus in dogs has only been recently observed. In 2004, an equine‐origin subtype H3N8 influenza A virus was isolated from dogs with respiratory disease,4 and, in 2008, an avian‐origin subtype (H3N2) was also isolated.5 Subsequently, the circulation of these subtypes has been documented in the canine population in diverse countries.6, 7, 8, 9 The influenza virus in these animals can lead to health problems related to respiratory syndromes and complications due to bacteria, and although horizontal transmission among dogs has been demonstrated, the rate of infection does not appear to be altered by age, breed, or sex.10, 11 In their respiratory tract, dogs possess specific receptors for infection with human and avian influenza viruses,12 thereby suggesting that dogs could play an important role in interspecies transmission of different subtypes of influenza A virus. Although no transmission of the virus from dogs to humans has been reported, dogs could represent a new bridging species for the infection.13
 There is serological evidence of the presence of subtypes H1N1 and H3N2 of human influenza virus in dogs; a virus similar to subtype H1N1pdm09 of humans has also been isolated from dogs.14, 15 In 2012, a new subtype H3N1 was identified as a result of reassortment in the canine genes of human H1N1pdm09 and canine H3N2 influenza viruses.16 The possible transmission of influenza A virus between dogs and humans is important, as in Mexico City there are approximately 1·2 million dogs, of which 1 million live in close contact with humans and other animals.17 The objective of this study was to identify the presence of antibodies against influenza A virus in dogs and their owners, as well as the presence of RNA of influenza A virus in nasal exudates of dogs and, thereby, assess the possible transmission of the virus between humans and dogs."
PMC4634296,2013-03-30,Worldwide transmission and seasonal variation of pandemic influenza A(H1N1)2009 virus activity during the 2009–2010 pandemic," Seasonal influenza activity varies with geography and time of year. OBJECTIVE To describe how pandemic influenza A(H1N1)2009 [A(H1N1)pdm09] activity varied during the 2009–2010 pandemic. METHODS We analyzed influenza virological data compiled by the World Health Organization from June 2009–August 2010. We calculated weekly proportions of A(H1N1)pdm09‐positive specimens out of all A(H1N1)pdm09‐positive specimens detected during the study period for each country. We compared parameters of pandemic activity (e.g., peak A[H1N1]pdm09 weekly proportion [peak activity], number of weeks between the 5th and 95th percentiles of A(H1N1)pdm09 cumulative weekly proportion [duration of activity]) between countries in temperate and tropical–subtropical regions. We quantified the proportion of A(H1N1)pdm09 out of all influenza A specimens by country and correlated it with countries' central latitudes. RESULTS We analyzed data from 80 countries (47 temperate, 33 tropical–subtropical). The median proportion of cases identified during the peak week was higher in temperate (0·12) than in tropical–subtropical (0·09) regions (P < 0·01). The median duration of activity was longer in tropical–subtropical (27 weeks) than in temperate countries (20 weeks) (P < 0·01). In most temperate countries (98%), peak pandemic activity occurred during the fall–winter period. There was a positive correlation between country central latitude and proportion of A(H1N1)pdm09 out of all influenza A specimens (r 0·76; P < 0·01). CONCLUSIONS The transmission of A(H1N1)pdm09 exhibited similarities with seasonal influenza transmission in that activity varied between temperate and tropical–subtropical countries and by time of year. Our findings suggest the potential utility of accounting for these factors during future pandemic planning.","Seasonal influenza transmission varies throughout the world with time of year and region.1 The mechanisms behind influenza seasonality are not well understood; however, multiple factors, including virological, immunological, environmental, and social factors likely contribute to the observed seasonal patterns of influenza transmission.2, 3 These factors give rise to annual influenza epidemics during the winter months in Northern and Southern Hemisphere temperate climates.4 In tropical and subtropical climates, influenza activity may be detected throughout the year, although there is increasing evidence of a notable seasonal component to influenza activity in some tropical countries.3, 5
 Pandemic influenza viruses can emerge at any time of year, but it is not clear whether the factors that drive yearly seasonal influenza transmission influence transmission of a novel virus to which the population has little immunity (resulting in increased population susceptibility, higher attack rates, and prolonged viral shedding in comparison with seasonal influenza). It has been postulated that there were seasonal variations in the transmission of pandemic influenza viruses during the 20th century, as they appeared to have had either a secondary or a tertiary wave of activity at the time of the historical influenza season.6, 7 The A(H1N1)pdm09 pandemic of 2009–2010 also demonstrated a seasonal component to transmission early during the pandemic, in the Americas.8 For example, surveillance during April to August 2009 pointed to higher rates of A(H1N1)pdm09 infection in Southern Hemisphere temperate countries, where the pandemic began at the time that seasonal influenza activity was expected.5, 9, 10

PMC4655090,2015-11-19,Rapid drop in the reproduction number during the Ebola outbreak in the Democratic Republic of Congo,"The Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) experienced a confined rural outbreak of Ebola virus disease (EVD) with 69 reported cases from July to October 2014. Understanding the transmission dynamics during the outbreak can provide important information for anticipating and controlling future EVD epidemics. I fitted an EVD transmission model to previously published data of this outbreak and estimated the basic reproduction number R = 5.2 (95% CI [4.0–6.7]). The model suggests that the net reproduction number R(t) fell below unity 28 days (95% CI [25–34] days) after the onset of symptoms in the index case. This study adds to previous epidemiological descriptions of the 2014 EVD outbreak in DRC, and is consistent with the notion that a rapid implementation of control interventions helped reduce further spread.","The Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) experienced a confined outbreak of Ebola virus disease (EVD) in rural areas of Équateur province. The first case became ill on 26 July 2014 and the last case started to show symptoms on 4 October 2014, resulting in a total of 69 reported cases (Maganga et al., 2014). The index case was a pregnant woman who died on 11 August 2014. A doctor and three health care workers performed a postmortem cesarean section, and all of them became infected and died. In total, 21 cases during the first 24 days of the outbreak had direct contact to the index case (Maganga et al., 2014). However, it remains unclear how many of these 21 cases acquired the infection from the index case, and how many infections were generated by subsequent cases. A better understanding of the transmission dynamics of the 2014 EVD outbreak in DRC can provide useful insights for the anticipation and control of current and future EVD epidemics in rural areas. The average number of secondary infections generated by an infectious index case at the beginning of an outbreak is described by the basic reproduction number R0 (Heffernan, Smith & Wahl, 2005). An outbreak can be brought under control once the net reproduction number Rt (also called the effective or instantaneous reproduction number) drops below unity. Several analyses of R0 and Rt for previous EVD outbreaks have given detailed insights into the transmission dynamics and the effectiveness of control interventions (Chowell et al., 2004; Althaus, 2014; Camacho et al., 2014; Althaus et al., 2015)."
PMC4731987,2016-01-29,Construction of the influenza A virus transmission tree in a college-based population: co-transmission and interactions between influenza A viruses," Co-infection of different influenza A viruses is known to occur but how viruses interact within co-infection remains unknown. An outbreak in a college campus during the 2009 pandemic involved two subtypes of influenza A persons infected with pandemic A/H1N1; persons infected with seasonal A/H3N2 viruses; and persons infected with both at the same time (co-infection). This provides data to analyse the possible interaction between influenza A viruses within co-infection. METHODS We extend a statistical inference method designed for outbreaks caused by one virus to that caused by two viruses. The method uses knowledge of which subtype each case is infected with (and whether they were co-infected), contact information and symptom onset date of each case in the influenza outbreak. We then apply it to construct the most likely transmission tree during the outbreak in the college campus. RESULTS Analysis of the constructed transmission tree shows that the simultaneous presence of the two influenza viruses increases the infectivity and the transmissibility of A/H1N1 virus but whether it changes the infectivity of A/H3N2 is unclear. The estimation also shows that co-transmission of both subtypes from co-infection is low and therefore co-infection cannot be sustained on its own. CONCLUSIONS This study suggests that influenza A viruses within co-infected patients can interact in some ways rather than transmit independently, and this can enhance the spread of influenza A virus infection. ELECTRONIC SUPPLEMENTARY MATERIAL The online version of this article (doi10.1186/s12879-016-1373-x) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.","Here we briefly summarize the data collection method and data of Liu et al. . Investigations were conducted on all influenza like illness (ILI) cases identified during the outbreak. Epidemiological, clinical and contact tracing data were collected by interviewing patients and retrieving medical records. Viruses were identified by reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction assays followed by sequence analysis. The heamagglutination inhibition tests were used to detect antibodies to both viruses. The outbreak is reported to have taken place within three buildings (two dormitories and one college clinic). No other cases at the college were reported. Buildings 1 and 2 (with a total membership of 235 and 191 persons, respectively) are next to each other and there is restricted access between the two and to the wider community. Forty five ILI cases were reported from 31 August to 10 September and forty (N = 40) had laboratory-confirmed influenza A infection. Three different types of infection were reported 22 infected with pandemic A/H1N1 virus, 12 infected with seasonal A/H3N2 virus and six co-infected with both influenza A viruses. In their sequences no substantial differences were observed between patients with mixed and single infections in either pandemic A/H1N1 or seasonal A/H3N2 virus. The clinical features were similar for patients with different infections and the six co-infected patients showed no more severe symptoms than the singly infected patients. Contacts between infected people are shown in Fig. 2 of Liu et al.  but this only extends to the contact network within one dormitory. The ‘index’ case with pandemic influenza A/H1N1 infection was a college student whose symptoms first occurred on 31 August, 2 days after his returning to college. Except for the index case, all patients with A/H1N1 infection had not left the campus during the previous week. In contrast, the source of seasonal A/H3N2 virus infection cannot be determined exactly although available data indicate that A/H3N2 virus might have been prevailing in the college when the pandemic H1N1 virus was introduced. Before the isolation of cases and the initiation of prophylaxis among the campus population (5 September 2009), several patients visited the college clinic and the mixing between students of different dormitories was not frequent in comparison to the mixing between students within each dormitory. Data that were used in the analysis of this study were extracted from a previous study  and hence did not require Human Resource Ethics committee approval."
PMC4854472,2016-05-03,"On Temporal Patterns and Circulation of Influenza Virus Strains in Taiwan, 2008-2014: Implications of 2009 pH1N1 Pandemic"," It has been observed that, historically, strains of pandemic influenza led to succeeding seasonal waves, albeit with decidedly different patterns. Recent studies suggest that the 2009 A(H1N1)pdm09 pandemic has had an impact on the circulation patterns of seasonal influenza strains in the post-pandemic years. In this work we aim to investigate this issue and also to compare the relative transmissibility of these waves of differing strains using Taiwan influenza surveillance data before, during and after the pandemic. METHODS We make use of the Taiwan Center for Disease Control and Prevention influenza surveillance data on laboratory-confirmed subtyping of samples and a mathematical model to determine the waves of circulating (and co-circulating) H1, H3 and B virus strains in Taiwan during 2008–2014; or namely, short before, during and after the 2009 pandemic. We further pinpoint the turning points and relative transmissibility of each wave, in order to ascertain whether any temporal pattern exists. RESULTS/FINDINGS For two consecutive years following the 2009 pandemic, A(H1N1)pdm09 circulated in Taiwan (as in most of Northern Hemisphere), sometimes co-circulating with AH3. From the evolution point of view, A(H1N1)pdm09 and AH3 were able to sustain their circulation patterns to the end of 2010. In fact, A(H1N1)pdm09 virus circulated in six separate waves in Taiwan between summer of 2009 and spring of 2014. Since 2009, a wave of A(H1N1)pmd09 occurred every fall/winter influenza season during our study period except 2011–2012 season, when mainly influenza strain B circulated. In comparing transmissibility, while the estimated per capita weekly growth rates for cumulative case numbers (and the reproduction number) seem to be lower for most of the influenza B waves (0.06~0.26; range of 95% CIs 0.05~0.32) when compared to those of influenza A, the wave of influenza B from week 8 to week 38 of 2010 immediately following the fall/winter wave of 2009 A(H1N1) pdm09 was substantially higher at r = 0.89 (95% CI 0.49, 1.28), in fact highest among all the waves detected in this study. Moreover, when AH3 or A(H1N1)pdm09 exhibit high incidence, reported cases of subtype B decreases and vice versa. Further modeling analysis indicated that during the study period, Taiwan nearly experienced at least one wave of influenza epidemic of some strain every summer except in 2012. DISCUSSION Estimates of R for seasonal influenza are consistent with that of temperate and tropical-subtropical regions, while estimate of R for A(H1N1)pdm09 is comparatively less than countries in Europe and North America, but similar to that of tropical-subtropical regions. This offers indication of regional differences in transmissibility of influenza virus that exists only for pandemic influenza. Despite obvious limitations in the data used, this study, designed to qualitatively compare the temporal patterns and transmissibility of the waves of different strains, illustrates how influenza subtyping data can be utilized to explore the mechanism for various influenza strains to compete or to circulate, to possibly provide predictors of future trends in the evolution of influenza viruses of various subtypes, and perhaps more importantly, to be of use to future annual seasonal influenza vaccine design.","According to World Health Organization (WHO) statistics, influenza occurs globally with an estimated annual attack rate of 5%-10% in adults and 20%–30% in children . These annual epidemics are estimated to result in approximately 3 to 5 million cases of severe illness worldwide and around 250 000 to 500 000 deaths, which is a major cause of losses in human lives and a grave global public health issue. Seasonal influenza typically occurs with annual regularity in temperate regions in autumn and winter, mainly in the Northern Hemisphere from October to March and in the Southern Hemisphere from April to September. However, influenza cases are reported almost year-round in tropical regions. Taiwan is located in the tropical-subtropical region of the Northern Hemisphere, split north-south near the middle of the island by the Tropic of Cancer. Influenza cases are reported throughout the year with some summer influenza epidemics, but with peak number of reported cases occurring annually in autumn and winter from late October to March . Moreover, studies have shown that excess influenza deaths during these months similar to those in the temperate zones can also observed in Taiwan [3–4]. It has also been proposed previously that Taiwan is an evolutionarily leading region for global circulation of influenza virus A (H3N2) . Moreover, past studies on sequence comparison of seasonal influenza strains A(H1N1) in Taiwan versus vaccine strains have showed that many vaccine-like Taiwanese strains in 1995–2003 were circulating at least 2 years before the vaccine strains were introduced . Hence investigating circulation patterns of seasonal influenza virus strains might shed lights on possible global circulation patterns in the following years."
PMC4877572,2016-05-24,Evidence for widespread infection of African bats with Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever-like viruses,"Crimean Congo hemorrhagic fever virus (CCHFV) is a highly virulent tick-borne pathogen that causes hemorrhagic fever in humans. The geographic range of human CCHF cases largely reflects the presence of ticks. However, highly similar CCHFV lineages occur in geographically distant regions. Tick-infested migratory birds have been suggested, but not confirmed, to contribute to the dispersal. Bats have recently been shown to carry nairoviruses distinct from CCHFV. In order to assess the presence of CCHFV in a wide range of bat species over a wide geographic range, we analyzed 1,135 sera from 16 different bat species collected in Congo, Gabon, Ghana, Germany, and Panama. Using a CCHFV glycoprotein-based indirect immunofluorescence test (IIFT), we identified reactive antibodies in 10.0% (114/1,135) of tested bats, pertaining to 12/16 tested species. Depending on the species, 3.6%–42.9% of cave-dwelling bats and 0.6%–7.1% of foliage-living bats were seropositive (two-tailed t-test, p = 0.0447 cave versus foliage). 11/30 IIFT-reactive sera from 10 different African bat species had neutralizing activity in a virus-like particle assay. Neutralization of full CCHFV was confirmed in 5 of 7 sera. Widespread infection of cave-dwelling bats may indicate a role for bats in the life cycle and geographic dispersal of CCHFV.","From 2003 through 2011 bats were sampled in Congo, Gabon, Ghana, Germany and Panama. The sample included 1,135 blood or serum specimens from 16 bat species pertaining to six different bat families with variable habitat preference and diet. To assess if bats harbor CCHF-like viruses, we screened bat serum samples for CCHFV GP-reactive antibodies by IIFT. In total, 114 of 1,135 (10.0%) sera from 12 of 16 bat species sampled between 2005 and 2009 in 4/5 countries reacted with recombinant CCHFV GP antigen (range 1.0–57.6%, Table 1, Fig. 1). An example of a reactive bat serum sample is shown in Fig. 2A. IIFT-positive detections were predominantly identified in cave-dwelling, migratory bats including the frugivorous species Rousettus aegyptiacus (24.4%; 48/197) as well as the insectivorous species Coleura afra (42.9%; 6/14), Hipposideros cf. caffer (6.3%; 3/48), Miniopterus inflatus (17.6%; 9/51) and Hipposideros gigas (24.8%; 32/129) from Congo and Gabon (Fig. 1). CCHFV seropositivity was significantly elevated for bat species that roost in caves versus those that roost in trees (Fig. 1; Supplementary Table 1; two-tailed t-test, p = 0.0447). In particular, bat species from the Batouala cave in Gabon, sampled in 2009, had highest seropositivity (range 18.4–57.6%; Table 1, Supplementary Figure). Age (p = 0.7434), dietary (p = 0.4622), gender (p = 0.4613), migration (p = 0.4788) and seasonality (p = 0.1605) were not associated with differences in seroprevalence (Supplementary Table 1). No antibodies were found in (n = 43) sera from New World bats, corresponding to the notion that CCHFV is an Old World virus2. As antibody cross-reactivity between CCHFV and viruses from the related NSDV serogroup cannot be completely ruled out by IIFT31, specific virus neutralization tests (NT) were done. NT can prove previous infection with CCHFV because there is no cross-neutralization between serogroups31. Because NTs require relatively large volumes of serum that cannot be obtained from most bat species, only for 30 of the 114 IIFT-positive sera covering 10/12 bat species, NT assays could be performed. In addition, 10 CCHFV IIFT-negative samples with sufficient volume, representing all 10 assessed bat species, were tested. Sera were tested at a 1100 dilution in a 96-well format using a recently established CCHF virus-like particle (VLP)-based NT27. Out of 30 IIFT-positive sera, 11 showed significant neutralizing activity defined as 80% reduction of luciferase luminescence signal (Fig. 2B, Supplementary Table 2). None of the 10 IIFT-negative control sera had neutralizing activity (Fig. 2B). In parallel, all 40 (30 IIFT-positive, 10 IIFT-negative) bat sera were tested in a Rift Valley fever (RVF) VLP-based NT32, all with negative results, ruling out nonspecific neutralization activity in bat sera (Fig. 3, Supplementary Table 2)."
PMC4895171,2016-06-07,"Transmission of Hand, Foot and Mouth Disease and Its Potential Driving Factors in Hong Kong","Hand-foot-and-mouth disease (HFMD) is a common childhood disease with substantial disease burden in Asia. Mixed results were reported on the associations between HFMD incidence and meteorological factors or school holidays, while limited studies focused on their association on transmissibility. We aimed to measure the transmissibility of HFMD and to examine its potential driving factors in Hong Kong. A likelihood-based procedure was used to estimate time-dependent effective reproduction number (R(t)) based on weekly number of HFMD-associated hospitalizations from 2010 to 2014. The associations of between-year effects, depletion of susceptibles, absolute humidity and school holidays with R(t) were examined using linear regression. R(t) usually started increasing between early spring and summer and peaked in April to May at around 1.1–1.2, followed by a slight rebound in autumn. Depletion of susceptibles and between-years effects explained most of the variances (19 and 13% respectively) in R(t). We found a negative association between depletion of susceptibles and R(t) (coefficients ranged from −0.14 to −0.03 for different years), but the estimated effects of absolute humidity and school holidays were insignificant. Overall, HFMD transmission was moderate in Hong Kong and was mainly associated with depletion of susceptibles. Limited impact was suggested from meteorological factors and school holidays.","Figure 1 shows the weekly HFMD-associated hospitalizations in Hong Kong between 1 January 2010 and 31 December 2014. Larger epidemics were observed in 2010 and 2013. A main summer peak from May to August was observed annually and the exponential growth phase usually started around March (Figs 1 and 2). Another milder autumn wave often occurred from September through early-October and sometimes extended into the winter. The HFMD epidemics usually peaked around the start of the summer holidays, and other school vacations usually fell outside the main peak of HFMD epidemics. Hong Kong has a humid summer with relatively stable peak absolute humidity in May and August (Fig. 1). The mean absolute humidity was 17.2 g/m3 and fluctuated from 12.7 to 24.5 g/m3 during the study periods. The smoothed effective reproduction number (Rt) for HFMD began to increase above 1 during early January and late March (Fig. 1). Disregarding the exceptionally high Rt estimates in early 2014 due to a small number of cases, the smoothed Rt peaked at 1.12 to 1.24 in April or May and subsequently declined to below 1 in June or July preceding the peaks of the epidemic curve. The smoothed Rt usually remained above 1 for around 4 to 5 months from spring to mid-summer. A rebound of Rt occurred between August and October in autumn, then afterwards fluctuated below 1 for most of the time during winter. In the sensitivity analyses, Rt peaked at 1.17 to 1.26 by assuming a mean serial interval of 2 days; while Rt peaked at 1.42 to 1.60 when assuming the mean as 7 days. A longer serial interval led to larger uncertainty in the Rt estimates and slightly shortened the duration with estimated Rt ≥ 1 (Supplementary Fig. 1). The assumption on case-hospitalization risk (CHR) did not affect the point estimate of Rt but will result in narrower 95% confidence intervals for a lower CHR (Supplementary Fig. 2)."
PMC4899695,2016-06-09,Host genetics determine susceptibility to avian influenza infection and transmission dynamics,"Host-genetic control of influenza virus infection has been the object of little attention. In this study we determined that two inbred lines of chicken differing in their genetic background , Lines 0 and C-B12, were respectively relatively resistant and susceptible to infection with the low pathogenicity influenza virus A/Turkey/England/647/77 as defined by substantial differences in viral shedding trajectories. Resistant birds, although infected, were unable to transmit virus to contact birds, as ultimately only the presence of a sustained cloacal shedding (and not oropharyngeal shedding) was critical for transmission. Restriction of within-bird transmission of virus occurred in the resistant line, with intra-nares or cloacal infection resulting in only local shedding and failing to transmit fully through the gastro-intestinal-pulmonary tract. Resistance to infection was independent of adaptive immune responses, including the expansion of specific IFNγ secreting cells or production of influenza-specific antibody. Genetic resistance to a novel H9N2 virus was less robust, though significant differences between host genotypes were still clearly evident. The existence of host-genetic determination of the outcome of influenza infection offers tools for the further dissection of this regulation and also for understanding the mechanisms of influenza transmission within and between birds.","We observed clear differences in the shedding trajectories, measured by qRT-PCR, of an H7N7 LPAI virus, (A/Turkey/England/647/77) between two inbred lines of bird experimentally infected through the nares. In the case of Line 0 birds, viral shedding from the oropharynx decreased steadily from the second day post infection (DPI) and stopped one week later. Oropharyngeal shedding in Line C-B12 birds was significantly higher from day 5 post-infection (p < 0.001) and continued throughout the 3 weeks experiment (Fig. 1A). There was a complete absence of the virus in cloacal swabs from Line 0 birds, while C-B12 birds showed a clear shedding of virus from this route for the entire three week period of the experiment (Fig. 1B). These effects were independent of the viral dose, as a lower dose of infection produced similar differences in oropharyngeal and cloacal swabs (Supplementary Fig. S1). We further confirmed the observed qRT-PCR results by analysis of infective virus by plaque assay (Supplementary Fig. S2). Virus was detected in oropharyngeal swabs in both lines, and the shedding decreased over time; the viral load and the number of positive samples in oropharyngeal swabs was significantly higher in Line C-B12 birds. The cloacal shedding of Line C-B12 birds was detected beyond two weeks after infection and not at all in Line 0."
PMC4941754,2012-05-23,"Inter‐ and intraspecies transmission of canine influenza virus (H3N2) in dogs, cats, and ferrets"," The emergence of zoonotic viruses in domestic animals is a significant public health concern. Canine influenza virus (CIV) H3N2 is a virus that can infect companion animals and is, therefore, a potential public health concern. Objective This study investigated the inter‐ and intraspecies transmission of CIV among dogs, cats, and ferrets, under laboratory conditions, to determine whether transmission of the virus was possible between as well as within these domestic animal species. Method The transmission routes for inter‐ and intraspecies transmission were airborne and direct contact, respectively. Transmission was conducted through intranasal infection of dogs followed by exposure to either cats or ferrets and by comingling infected and naïve animals of the same species. Results The interspecies transmission of CIV H3N2 via airborne was only observed from dogs to cats and not from dogs to ferrets. However, direct intranasal infection of either cats or ferrets with CIV could induce influenza‐like clinical signs, viral shedding, and serological responses. Additionally, naïve cats and ferrets could be infected by CIV via direct contact with infected animals of the same species. Conclusion Cats appear to be another susceptible host of CIV H3N2, whereas ferrets are not likely natural hosts. The molecular‐based mechanism of interspecies and intraspecies transmission of CIV H3N2 should be further studied.","Canine influenza virus (CIV) H3N2 is a virus of avian origin and was first reported in 2007.
1
 Dogs were demonstrated to have avian influenza virus receptors in their lower respiratory tract, and all gene segments of CIV H3N2 were shown to be homologous to avian influenza viruses; therefore, interspecies transmission of influenza virus from birds to dogs was suggested to be possible.
1
 Furthermore, a recent study reported the susceptibility of cats to CIV H3N2 infection, suggesting the possibility of the emergence of recombinant, potentially zoonotic, feline, or CIVs in companion animals.
2
 The emergence of novel, recombinant influenza viruses with zoonotic potential is a significant public health concern.
3
 The concern is elevated further when the viruses can be transmitted between different species of animals that are in frequent contact with humans. For example, a triple reassortant H3N2 influenza virus isolated from pigs was shown to replicate and be transmissible among turkeys.
4
 Such evidence amplifies the concerns about interspecies transmission of CIV H3N2 between different domestic animal species and underscores the concern that these same viruses might also be able to infect humans who come in contact with the animals. The possibility of intraspecies transmission (dog‐to‐dog) of CIV H3N2 was demonstrated by direct contact between infected and naïve dogs.
5
 Surveillance data show that the percentage of pet dogs that are seropositive for CIV H3N2 has dramatically increased from 0·48%  to 5·2–6·5% ,
6
, 
7
 indicating continuous transmission among pet dogs. As cats, another popular domestic animal, have already been demonstrated to host CIV H3N2, intraspecies transmission among cat populations is also possible but not yet demonstrated. Ferrets are also known to be susceptible to influenza A infection and display many clinical signs of human influenza infection with a similar complexity of signs.
8
 Therefore, ferrets can be considered to predict the possibility for interspecies transmission of CIV H3N2 to humans."

The new influenza virus A/H1N1 , identified in mid‐2009, rapidly spread over the world. Estimating the transmissibility of this new virus was a public health priority. Methods We reviewed all studies presenting estimates of the serial interval or generation time and the reproduction number of the A/H1N1  virus infection. Results Thirteen studies documented the serial interval from household or close‐contact studies, with overall mean 3 days (95% CI 2·4, 3·6); taking into account tertiary transmission reduced this estimate to 2·6 days. Model‐based estimates were more variable, from 1·9 to 6 days. Twenty‐four studies reported reproduction numbers for community‐based epidemics at the town or country level. The range was 1·2–3·1, with larger estimates reported at the beginning of the pandemic. Accounting for under‐reporting in the early period of the pandemic and limiting variation because of the choice of the generation time interval, the reproduction number was between 1·2 and 2·3 with median 1·5. Discussion The serial interval of A/H1N1  flu was typically short, with mean value similar to the seasonal flu. The estimates of the reproduction number were more variable. Compared with past influenza pandemics, the median reproduction number was similar  or slightly smaller (1889, 1918, 1957).","In April 2009, a new influenza virus A/H1N1  was isolated in Mexico and has rapidly spread over the world, being reported in 214 countries 1 year after its first identification.

 As soon as the new virus was identified, a major issue was to estimate the transmissibility of the new virus. In the guidance document ‘Global surveillance during an influenza pandemic’ released by the World Health Organization, three parameters were highlighted that should be documented quickly in this respect the incubation period (time between infection and symptoms), the serial interval (time between symptoms onset in primary case and secondary case), and the reproduction ratio/number (average number of secondary cases per primary case).

PMC4951043,2016-07-19,Heterogeneity in District-Level Transmission of Ebola Virus Disease during the 2013-2015 Epidemic in West Africa,"The Ebola virus disease (EVD) epidemic in West Africa in 2013–2015 spread heterogeneously across the three hardest-hit countries Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone and the estimation of national transmission of EVD provides little information about local dynamics. To investigate district-level transmissibility of EVD, we applied a statistical modelling approach to estimate the basic reproduction number (R) for each affected district and each country using weekly incident case numbers. We estimated growth rates during the early exponential phase of the outbreak using exponential regression of the case counts on the first eight weeks since onset. To take into account the heterogeneity between and within countries, we fitted a mixed effects model and calculated R based on the predicted individual growth rates and the reported serial interval distribution. At district level, R ranged from 0.36 (Dubréka) to 1.72 (Beyla) in Guinea, from 0.53 (Maryland) to 3.37 (Margibi) in Liberia and from 1.14 (Koinadugu) to 2.73 (Western Rural) in Sierra Leone. At national level, we estimated an R of 0.97 (95% CI 0.77–1.18) for Guinea, 1.26 (95% CI 0.98–1.55) for Liberia and 1.66 (95% CI 1.32–2.00) for Sierra Leone. Socio-demographic variables related to urbanisation such as high population density and high wealth index were found positively associated with R suggesting that the consequences of fast urban growth in West Africa may have contributed to the increased spread of EVD.","The Ebola virus disease (EVD) outbreak that started in December 2013 in Guinea developed into the largest EVD epidemic ever observed. There has been some discussion about the geographical heterogeneity of disease transmission in the three hardest hit countries in West Africa [1–8], but other studies have not considered this effect in their analysis. An epidemic of this scale has an intrinsic multi-level structure and national epidemic curves are always an overlay of local outbreaks [9–11]. Consequently, the estimation of national transmission offers little information about subnational dynamics. The availability of district-level data provides a unique opportunity to investigate local disease transmission during the 2013–2015 epidemic. We may also use these data to quantify population-level risk factors for EVD transmission. Demographic or behavioural factors such as crowding and high population density, low socioeconomic status (SES), unsafe burials or poor sanitation but also climate effects might have contributed to enhanced EVD transmission in West Africa, but these effects have been assessed only in a limited number of studies [1,7,11,12]. In the context of recurrent infectious diseases, increased human mobility and globalisation the quantification of subnational spread of EVD and the investigation of factors related to the spread might provide insights that could improve epidemic management in the future . The most frequently used parameter for quantifying transmissibility is the basic reproduction number R0, which describes the average number of secondary infections generated by a primary case during the initial phase of an outbreak when the population is completely susceptible and no control measures have been employed . A common approach to the estimation of R0 consists of fitting mathematical transmission models to observed outbreak data. In the West African EVD epidemic, several mathematical modelling studies have described the variation in R0 between [6,10,14–19] and within [20–25] the three countries. Most studies found estimates of R0 ranging between 1.5 and 2.5, agreeing with results from models of earlier outbreaks ranging from 1.4–4.7 (summarised in ). A drawback of mechanistic models is the requirement of a large number of parameters, which is problematic with sparse data . As an alternative to mechanistic models, R0 can be inferred from the generation time and the intrinsic growth rate r (sometimes also referred to as Ʌ) during the early, exponential epidemic phase . The generation time is the average interval between infection of a primary and a secondary case. The growth rate r is defined as the per capita change in case numbers per time unit. It can be calculated directly from the observed empirical data by estimating the slope of the natural log-transformed cumulative case counts over time with a linear regression model [28,29] or by fitting an exponential or sigmoid curve to incident case counts [27,30]. The use of incident case data is generally preferred over cumulative case data because the individual observations are statistically independent . Ignoring the dependence of measurement error in cumulative cases can lead to over-optimistic standard errors and thus underestimation of uncertainty in epidemic growth . This statistical approach is particularly useful for the assessment of smaller outbreaks with sparse data , as observed in certain districts during the West African EVD epidemic. The analysis of local transmissibility should take into account the hierarchical nature of subnational data, because these cases are not completely independent but arise from a common population i.e. country. Such an epidemic structure can be approached with a mixed effects model, which explicitly allows for clustering."
PMC4985757,2016-08-16,Insights into the transmission of respiratory infectious diseases through empirical human contact networks,"In this study, we present representative human contact networks among Chinese college students. Unlike schools in the US, human contacts within Chinese colleges are extremely clustered, partly due to the highly organized lifestyle of Chinese college students. Simulations of influenza spreading across real contact networks are in good accordance with real influenza records; however, epidemic simulations across idealized scale-free or small-world networks show considerable overestimation of disease prevalence, thus challenging the widely-applied idealized human contact models in epidemiology. Furthermore, the special contact pattern within Chinese colleges results in disease spreading patterns distinct from those of the US schools. Remarkably, class cancelation, though simple, shows a mitigating power equal to quarantine/vaccination applied on ~25% of college students, which quantitatively explains its success in Chinese colleges during the SARS period. Our findings greatly facilitate reliable prediction of epidemic prevalence, and thus should help establishing effective strategies for respiratory infectious diseases control.","Using the PEARL application, we collected real CPI data amongst 174 undergraduates for 28 days (between October 31 and November 27, 2011) in a typical college in southern China (South China Agricultural University, or SCAU). To mitigate potential bias rooted at geographical locations, this data-gathering program was also carried out at a college in northern China (University of Science and Technology of Beijing, or USTB) to collect real CPI data from 87 undergraduates for 28 days (between October 24 and November 20, 2011). On the mobile phone of each volunteer, a PEARL client was installed to scan nearby PEARL clients via Bluetooth technique every 5 minutes. The detected Bluetooth addresses and scan time were recorded. Thus, in every 5 minutes, the CPI data was obtained among the individuals, from which a basic network was reconstructed with every node representing an individual, and every edge representing a 5-minute CPI among two individuals. The summation of all 288 (24 × 60/5 = 288) basic networks in a certain day formed a daily aggregation of CPI networks, where edge weights denote the aggregate CPI duration in the entire day.

In particular, all the volunteers were required to report their health condition from September 25 to October 21, 2011.

PMC5014060,2016-08-03,Inferring R(0) in emerging epidemics—the effect of common population structure is small,"When controlling an emerging outbreak of an infectious disease, it is essential to know the key epidemiological parameters, such as the basic reproduction number R and the control effort required to prevent a large outbreak. These parameters are estimated from the observed incidence of new cases and information about the infectious contact structures of the population in which the disease spreads. However, the relevant infectious contact structures for new, emerging infections are often unknown or hard to obtain. Here, we show that, for many common true underlying heterogeneous contact structures, the simplification to neglect such structures and instead assume that all contacts are made homogeneously in the whole population results in conservative estimates for R and the required control effort. This means that robust control policies can be planned during the early stages of an outbreak, using such conservative estimates of the required control effort.","An important area of infectious disease epidemiology is concerned with the planning for mitigation and control of new emerging epidemics. The importance of such planning has been highlighted during epidemics over recent decades, such as human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) around 1980 , severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2002/2003 , the influenza A H1N1 pandemic in 2009  and the Ebola outbreak in West Africa, which started in 2014 . A key priority is the early and rapid assessment of the transmission potential of the emerging infection. This transmission potential is often summarized by the expected number of new infections caused by a typical infected individual during the early phase of the outbreak, and is usually denoted by the basic reproduction number, R0. Another key priority is estimation of the proportion of infected individuals we should isolate before they become infectious, and thus completely prevent them from spreading the disease to any other individuals in order to break the chain of transmission. This quantity is denoted as the required control effort, vc. From a modelling perspective, vc is equivalent to the critical vaccination coverage if a vaccine is available, then the required control effort is equal to the proportion of the population that needs to be immunized in order to stop the outbreak, if the immunized people are chosen uniformly at random. These key quantities are inferred from available observations on symptom onset dates of cases and the generation times, i.e. the typical duration between time of infection of a case and infection of its infector [5,6]. The inference procedure for R0 and vc requires information on the infectious contact structure (‘who contacts whom’), information that is typically not available or hard to obtain quickly for emerging infections. The novelty of this paper lies in that we assess the estimators for the basic reproduction number R0 and required control effort vc, which are based on usually available observations, over a wide range of assumptions about the underlying infectious contact structure. We find that most plausible contact structures result in only slightly different estimates of R0 and vc. Furthermore, we find that ignoring the infectious contact pattern, thus effectively assuming that individuals mix homogeneously, will in many cases result in a slight overestimation of these key epidemiological quantities, even if the actual contact structure is far from homogeneous. This is important good news for planning for mitigation and control of emerging infections, because the relevant contact structure is typically unknown ignoring the contact structures results in slightly conservative estimates for R0 and vc. This is a significant justification for basing infection control policies on estimates of R0 derived for the Ebola outbreak in West Africa in , for which, although we know that transmission is mainly due to close and intimate contact with bodily fluids, it is hard to obtain data on who regularly has such contact with whom. Therefore, the data are stratified by region, without further assumptions on contact structure."

OBJECTIVE This study reports a systematic review of the epidemiology of HFMD in Asia. DATA SOURCES PubMed, Web of Science and Google Scholar were searched up to December 2014. STUDY SELECTION Two reviewers independently assessed studies for epidemiologic and serologic information about prevalence and incidence of HFMD against predetermined inclusion/exclusion criteria. DATA EXTRACTION Two reviewers extracted answers for 8 specific research questions on HFMD epidemiology. The results are checked by 3 others. RESULTS HFMD is found to be seasonal in temperate Asia with a summer peak and in subtropical Asia with spring and fall peaks, but not in tropical Asia; evidence of a climatic role was identified for temperate Japan. Risk factors for HFMD include hygiene, age, gender and social contacts, but most studies were underpowered to adjust rigorously for confounding variables. Both community-level and school-level transmission have been implicated, but their relative importance for HFMD is inconclusive. Epidemiologic indices are poorly understood No supporting quantitative evidence was found for the incubation period of EV-A71; the symptomatic rate of EV-A71/Coxsackievirus A16 infection was from 10% to 71% in 4 studies; while the basic reproduction number was between 1.1 and 5.5 in 3 studies. The uncertainty in these estimates inhibits their use for further analysis. LIMITATIONS Diversity of study designs complicates attempts to identify features of HFMD epidemiology. CONCLUSIONS Knowledge on HFMD remains insufficient to guide interventions such as the incorporation of an EV-A71 vaccine in pediatric vaccination schedules. Research is urgently needed to fill these gaps.","Using a combination of search terms, including “Hand foot and mouth disease,” “Hand foot and mouth,” “HFMD,” “Enterovirus,” “Enterovirus 71,” “EV-A71,” “Coxsackie A16,” “CV-A16,” “CVA16,” we searched PubMed, Thomson Reuters Web of Science and Google Scholar to identify 1305, 1255 and 100 articles, respectively. Eligibility criteria were articles that  were published in peer-reviewed journals from January 1957 to December 2014;  were studies with epidemiologic and/or serologic information (quantitative/qualitative) about incidence and prevalence of HFMD; and/or  contained information about factors associated with prevalence and incidence and/or  employed statistical models to derive the above. Articles not in English, not related to HFMD, or HFMD articles that did not cover epidemiologic or clinical factors were excluded."
PMC5145133,2016-12-08,Spatiotemporal Analysis of the 2014 Ebola Epidemic in West Africa,"In 2014–2016, Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia in West Africa experienced the largest and longest Ebola epidemic since the discovery of the virus in 1976. During the epidemic, incidence data were collected and published at increasing resolution. To monitor the epidemic as it spread within and between districts, we develop an analysis method that exploits the full spatiotemporal resolution of the data by combining a local model for time-varying effective reproduction numbers with a gravity-type model for spatial dispersion of the infection. We test this method in simulations and apply it to the weekly incidences of confirmed and probable cases per district up to June 2015, as reported by the World Health Organization. Our results indicate that, of the newly infected cases, only a small percentage, between 4% and 10%, migrates to another district, and a minority of these migrants, between 0% and 23%, leave their country. The epidemics in the three countries are found to be similar in estimated effective reproduction numbers, and in the probability of importing infection into a district. The countries might have played different roles in cross-border transmissions, although a sensitivity analysis suggests that this could also be related to underreporting. The spatiotemporal analysis method can exploit available longitudinal incidence data at different geographical locations to monitor local epidemics, determine the extent of spatial spread, reveal the contribution of local and imported cases, and identify sources of introductions in uninfected areas. With good quality data on incidence, this data-driven method can help to effectively control emerging infections.","Over the last decades, infectious disease modelling has become an established tool to assess the effect of control measures and to inform infection control. Such analysis methods have for instance been applied to local outbreaks of SARS , Chikungunya  and MERS CoV . However, when an outbreak is distributed over a larger area, the spatial aggregation of epidemic data can result in time series that are too coarse to adequately capture the disease dynamics . Ideally, the analysis should allow for the higher spatial resolution of the data . The recent Ebola epidemic provides such a case in which extended spatiotemporal data were collected. In 2014, West Africa was heavily affected by an epidemic of Zaire Ebola virus that was unprecedented in its magnitude . Earlier epidemics in the east and middle of the African continent were usually confined to a limited area and brought under control within a few months . Similarly, the West African epidemic began in a rural area around Guéckédou, Guinea at the end of 2013, but started to deviate from the typical pattern when cases were observed first in Guéckédou City and later in the large urban area of capital Conakry. Around the same time the infection spread from the border area around Guéckédou into Liberia, followed by Sierra Leone two months later. Their capitals Monrovia and Freetown were infected shortly after these incursions, allowing the virus to spread in highly urbanised populations with limited health care facilities. In July 2014, the WHO recognised the Ebola epidemic as a public health emergency of international concern. While aid programs were being extended and implemented, the epidemic reached its peak in the autumn of 2014, when hundreds of cases were reported weekly. Subsequently, incidence rates started to decline, bringing the epidemic gradually under control. All countries were declared free of Ebola at some point in 2015, but transmission seems to be ongoing at a low level as evidenced by the sporadic observation of new cases."
PMC5319820,2017-02-08,Comparative analysis estimates the relative frequencies of co-divergence and cross-species transmission within viral families,"The cross-species transmission of viruses from one host species to another is responsible for the majority of emerging infections. However, it is unclear whether some virus families have a greater propensity to jump host species than others. If related viruses have an evolutionary history of co-divergence with their hosts there should be evidence of topological similarities between the virus and host phylogenetic trees, whereas host jumping generates incongruent tree topologies. By analyzing co-phylogenetic processes in 19 virus families and their eukaryotic hosts we provide a quantitative and comparative estimate of the relative frequency of virus-host co-divergence versus cross-species transmission among virus families. Notably, our analysis reveals that cross-species transmission is a near universal feature of the viruses analyzed here, with virus-host co-divergence occurring less frequently and always on a subset of viruses. Despite the overall high topological incongruence among virus and host phylogenies, the Hepadnaviridae, Polyomaviridae, Poxviridae, Papillomaviridae and Adenoviridae, all of which possess double-stranded DNA genomes, exhibited more frequent co-divergence than the other virus families studied here. At the other extreme, the virus and host trees for all the RNA viruses studied here, particularly the Rhabdoviridae and the Picornaviridae, displayed high levels of topological incongruence, indicative of frequent host switching. Overall, we show that cross-species transmission plays a major role in virus evolution, with all the virus families studied here having the potential to jump host species, and that increased sampling will likely reveal more instances of host jumping.","Emerging pathogens that cross the species barrier to infect new hosts can profoundly affect human and animal health, as well as wildlife and the agricultural industries. Although most emerging diseases seemingly result from such a process of cross-species transmission, it is also the case that some viruses seem to rarely jump the species barrier and instead co-diverge with their hosts over long stretches of evolutionary time. For example, long-term virus-host co-divergence has been suggested to play a key role in the evolution of vertebrate herpesviruses over periods of ~400 million years  and insect baculoviruses over a time-scale of ~310 million years . Indeed, it has been proposed that a number of families of DNA viruses have co-diverged with their hosts over long evolutionary time-scales [3–5], and do so more frequently than RNA viruses, which in contrast display a combination of co-divergence and host switching . In particular, while phylogenetic trees for some RNA viruses, such as particular retroviruses, are generally congruent with those from their hosts suggesting long-term co-divergence , for others, such as flaviviruses, host jumping appears to be relatively frequent . In the case of flaviviruses this likely in part reflects the fact that many are transmitted by arthropod vectors and characterized by short durations of infection. The situation appears to be even more complex in cases such as the hantaviruses where there is evidence of both co-divergence and host jumping . Given the evolutionary and ecological barriers a virus must overcome to cross the species barrier and successfully establish itself in a new host, it might seem reasonable to assume that successful cross-species transmission is a relatively rare occurrence . Indeed, many emerging diseases are in reality ‘spill-over’ infections, in which onward transmission between members of a new host species is limited such that extinction of the novel virus occurs rapidly . Nevertheless, it is possible that an increased sampling of hosts and their viruses will reveal more instances of host jumping, in turn implying that cross-species transmission is a fundamental aspect of virus evolution . As a case in point, although there is strong evidence that hepadnaviruses have co-diverged with their vertebrate hosts over hundreds of millions of years , the recent identification of hepadnaviruses in fish and amphibians has revealed more instances of cross-species transmission, potentially including that from aquatic to terrestrial vertebrates ."
PMC5320693,2017-02-21,A statistical method utilizing information of imported cases to estimate the transmissibility for an influenza pandemic," In a new influenza pandemic, travel data such as arrival times of cases seeded by the originating country can be regarded as a combination of the epidemic size and the mobility networks of infections connecting the originating country with other regions. It can be a complete and timely source for estimating the basic reproduction number (R ), a key indicator of disease transmissibility. METHOD In this study, we developed a likelihood-based method using arrival times of infected cases in different countries to estimate R  for influenza pandemics. A simulation was conducted to assess the performance of the proposed method. We further applied the method to the outbreak of the influenza pandemic A/H1N1 in Mexico. RESULTS In the numerical application, the estimated R  was equal to 1.69 with a 95% confidence interval (1.65, 1.73). For the simulation results, the estimations were robust to the decline of travel rate and other parameter assumptions. Nevertheless, the estimates were moderately sensitive to the assumption of infectious duration. Generally, the findings were in line with other relevant studies. CONCLUSIONS Our approach as well as the estimate is potential to assist officials in planning control and prevention measures. Improved coordination to streamline or even centralize surveillance of imported cases among countries will thus be beneficial to public health.","In responding to infectious disease outbreaks in the 21st century, a reliable method to estimate the transmission intensity during the early phases of a new influenza pandemic is critical. The basic reproduction number (R
0), defined as the average number of secondary infections produced by a typical infectious individual in a whole susceptible population, is a common measure of disease transmissibility. Valid and reliable estimate of the R
0 can assist officials in planning control and prevention measures for an influenza pandemic. On the contrary, underestimation of the disease transmissibility will induce an insufficient public awareness on the risk of infection and therefore lower the general public’s incentive to protect themselves against infectious diseases through vaccines, hand washing or other protective measures. Many kinds of data such as sentinel surveillance of influenza-like-illness (ILI), serological survey, and syndromic data are able to infer the transmissibility of infectious diseases. Common surveillance data can be fitted into an exponential growth model or Kermack-McKendrick-type models to estimate R
0 [1, 2]. Likelihood-based methods are an alternative [3, 4]. Chowell et al.  showed that these types of methods are not sensitive on R
0 estimation given an acceptable goodness of fit. Nevertheless, one of the caveats of using ILI surveillance data is the underreporting although several approaches were developed to adjust this problem ."
PMC5322982,2017-02-10,Mosquito cell-derived West Nile virus replicon particles mimic arbovirus inoculum and have reduced spread in mice,"Half of the human population is at risk of infection by an arthropod-borne virus. Many of these arboviruses, such as West Nile, dengue, and Zika viruses, infect humans by way of a bite from an infected mosquito. This infectious inoculum is insect cell-derived giving the virus particles distinct qualities not present in secondary infectious virus particles produced by infected vertebrate host cells. The insect cell-derived particles differ in the glycosylation of virus structural proteins and the lipid content of the envelope, as well as their induction of cytokines. Thus, in order to accurately mimic the inoculum delivered by arthropods, arboviruses should be derived from arthropod cells. Previous studies have packaged replicon genome in mammalian cells to produce replicon particles, which undergo only one round of infection, but no studies exist packaging replicon particles in mosquito cells. Here we optimized the packaging of West Nile virus replicon genome in mosquito cells and produced replicon particles at high concentration, allowing us to mimic mosquito cell-derived viral inoculum. These particles were mature with similar genome equivalents-to-infectious units as full-length West Nile virus. We then compared the mosquito cell-derived particles to mammalian cell-derived particles in mice. Both replicon particles infected skin at the inoculation site and the draining lymph node by 3 hours post-inoculation. The mammalian cell-derived replicon particles spread from the site of inoculation to the spleen and contralateral lymph nodes significantly more than the particles derived from mosquito cells. This in vivo difference in spread of West Nile replicons in the inoculum demonstrates the importance of using arthropod cell-derived particles to model early events in arboviral infection and highlights the value of these novel arthropod cell-derived replicon particles for studying the earliest virus-host interactions for arboviruses.","Arthropod-borne viruses are transmitted between arthropod vectors, such as ticks and mosquitos, and their vertebrate hosts. Mosquito-borne flaviviruses, such as dengue, Zika, and West Nile viruses (WNV), are responsible for a variety of debilitating pathologies, including hemorrhagic fever, encephalitis, flaccid paralysis, and microcephaly. WNV alone has accounted for over 20,000 cases of neuroinvasive disease in the United States since it emerged in New York City in 1999 . Human cases of WNV have been documented on all continents except Antarctica making it the most widespread viral cause of encephalitis (reviewed in ) and an important pathogen for study. In addition, a robust mouse model makes it an excellent system to study arboviral pathogenesis. WNV has a single-stranded, positive-sense RNA genome that codes for a polyprotein, which is co- and post-translationally cleaved into 10 proteins. Three structural proteins make up the virion capsid (C), premembrane/membrane (prM/M), and envelope (E). C protein packages the genome into a nucleocapsid, which buds into the ER membrane containing E and prM and forms an immature particle (reviewed in ). E and prM proteins are subsequently glycosylated by the host cell machinery. Fully mature particles are formed when prM is cleaved by host cell proteases in the Golgi, resulting in M and E in the viral envelope and structural rearrangement of the particle, prior to release from the host cell ."
PMC5336357,2017-02-13,"Folding behavior of a T-shaped, ribosome-binding translation enhancer implicated in a wide-spread conformational switch","Turnip crinkle virus contains a T-shaped, ribosome-binding, translation enhancer (TSS) in its 3’UTR that serves as a hub for interactions throughout the region. The viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) causes the TSS/surrounding region to undergo a conformational shift postulated to inhibit translation. Using optical tweezers (OT) and steered molecular dynamic simulations (SMD), we found that the unusual stability of pseudoknotted element H4a/Ψ required five upstream adenylates, and H4a/Ψ was necessary for cooperative association of two other hairpins (H5/H4b) in Mg(2+). SMD recapitulated the TSS unfolding order in the absence of Mg(2+), showed dependence of the resistance to pulling on the 3D orientation and gave structural insights into the measured contour lengths of the TSS structure elements. Adenylate mutations eliminated one-site RdRp binding to the 3’UTR, suggesting that RdRp binding to the adenylates disrupts H4a/Ψ, leading to loss of H5/H4b interaction and promoting a conformational switch interrupting translation and promoting replication. DOI ","RNAs play key roles in a variety of cellular functions due to their capacity to fold into a number of functionally competent and dynamic structures (Balvay et al., 2009; Dethoff et al., 2012; Serganov and Patel, 2007; Simon and Miller, 2013). Driven by conformational plasticity, RNA elements can assume alternative forms required for different biological functions (Dethoff et al., 2012; Simon and Gehrke, 2009). For example, riboswitches in untranslated regions (UTRs) of bacterial genes can cycle between active and inactive conformations through binding to small metabolites, thereby inhibiting translation or attenuating transcription of downstream genes (Soukup and Soukup, 2004; Winkler and Breaker, 2003). Regulatory RNA elements found in viral RNA genomes can also switch between mutually exclusive conformations to regulate incompatible processes such as translation and replication (D'Souza and Summers, 2004; Huthoff and Berkhout, 2001; Patel et al., 2015; Simon and Gehrke, 2009; Stammler et al., 2011; Stupina et al., 2008; Yuan et al., 2009). To gain insights into how RNAs transition between alternative conformations, we have studied the folding and unfolding pathways of a 3’ cap-independent translation enhancer (3’CITE) found in the 3´ UTR of TCV. TCV is a positive-strand RNA virus (genus Carmovirus, family Tombusviridae) with a single uncapped, non-poly(A) genome of 4053 nt encoding five proteins (Figure 1—figure supplement 1). The TCV 3’UTR contains at least five hairpins (H4, H4a, H4b, H5 and Pr) and three critical H-type pseudoknots (Ψ1, Ψ2, Ψ3) (McCormack et al., 2008; Simon and Miller, 2013), a type of RNA structure that forms when loop residues in a hairpin pair with nearby residues to create a second stem-loop. The coaxially stacked double pseudoknots H4a/Ψ3 and H4b/Ψ2 in conjunction with hairpin H5 fold into a T-shaped structure known as the TSS (McCormack et al., 2008). The TSS serves as a 3’CITE by binding to 80S ribosomes at the P-site through an interaction with the 60S ribosomal subunit (Stupina et al., 2008). Substituting the entire TSS or H4a/Ψ3/H4b with the analogous regions from the related Cardamine chlorotic fleck virus (CCFV) led to viral genomic (g)RNA accumulation that was similar to or greater than wild-type (wt) TCV. In contrast, TCV gRNA accumulated poorly when individual hairpins or other combinations of CCFV hairpins and pseudoknots were substituted. These results suggested that all, or a specific subset of hairpins and pseudoknots, function as a structural domain or subdomain (McCormack et al., 2008)."
PMC5363263,2017-03-21,Temporal patterns and geographic heterogeneity of Zika virus (ZIKV) outbreaks in French Polynesia and Central America," Zika virus (ZIKV) transmission has been reported in 67 countries/territories in the Oceania region and the Americas since 2015, prompting the World Health Organization (WHO) to declare ZIKV as a Public Health Emergency of International Concern in February 2016, due to its strong association with medical complications such as microcephaly and Guillain–Barré Syndrome (GBS). However, a substantial gap in knowledge still exists regarding differing temporal pattern and potential of transmission of ZIKV in different regions of the world. METHODS We use a phenomenological model to ascertain the temporal patterns and transmission potential of ZIKV in various countries/territories, by fitting the model to Zika case data from Yap Island and French Polynesia in the Oceania region and 11 countries/territories with confirmed case data, namely, Colombia, Ecuador, French Guiana, Guadeloupe, Guatemala, Mexico, Nicaragua, Panama, Puerto Rico, Saint Martin, and Suriname, to pinpoint the waves of infections in each country/territory and to estimate the respective basic reproduction number R. RESULTS Six of these time series datasets resulted in statistically significant model fit of at least one wave of reported cases, namely that of French Polynesia, Colombia, Puerto Rico, Guatemala, Suriname and Saint Martin. However, only Colombia and Guatemala exhibited two waves of cases while the others had only one wave. Temporal patterns of the second wave in Colombia and the single wave in Suriname are very similar, with the respective turning points separated by merely a week. Moreover, the mean estimates of R for Colombia, Guatemala and Suriname, all land-based populations, range between 1.05 and 1.75, while the corresponding mean estimates for R of island populations in French Polynesia, Puerto Rico and Saint Martin are significantly lower with a range of 5.70–6.89. We also fit the Richards model to Zika case data from six main archipelagos in French Polynesia, suggesting the outbreak in all six island populations occurred during the same time, albeit with different peak time, with mean R range of 3.09–5.05. DISCUSSION Using the same modeling methodology, in this study we found a significant difference between transmissibility (as quantified by R) in island populations as opposed to land-based countries/territories, possibly suggesting an important role of geographic heterogeneity in the spread of vector-borne diseases and its future course, which requires further monitoring. Our result has potential implications for planning respective intervention and control policies targeted for island and land-based populations.","Zika virus (ZIKV), a flavivirus, has been known since its first isolation from a primate in 1947 in the Zika forest of Uganda, and a year later in 1948 from Aedes africanus mosquitos in the same location (Dick, Kitchen & Haddow, 1952). Serological evidence of ZIKV infection in humans has been reported since 1951, but it had been confined to the equatorial regions of Africa and Asia until recently (Pierson & Diamond, 2013). Moreover, Aedes aegypti mosquitos have been found to be the primary transmitter of Zika virus in human populations in the more recent outbreaks in the Americas (Monaghan et al., 2016). Available scientific evidence strongly suggests that Zika virus causes Guillain–Barré Syndrome (GBS) (Cao-Lormeau et al., 2016; De Paula Freitas et al., 2016). Moreover, Zika infection in pregnant women is reported to associate with, among other medical complications, microcephaly in their infants (Brasil et al., 2016; Cauchemez et al., 2016), fetal deaths, stillbirths, and central nervous system lesions (Sarno et al., 2016). As of August 25, 2016, a total of 466,815 suspected and 111,333 confirmed autochthonous transmission cases have been reported in 47 countries/territories in the Americas from Mexico to Argentina, with 10 deaths among the reported cases (Pan American Health Organization, 2016a). Moreover, Zika virus (ZIKV) transmission has been reported in 67 countries/territories in the Oceania region and the Americas since 2015. Currently without vaccines or medication for treatment, the global Zika outbreaks have prompted the World Health Organization (WHO) to declare ZIKV as a Public Health Emergency of International Concern in February 2016 (World Health Organization, 2016)."
PMC5434075,2017-06-28,Spread of competing viruses on heterogeneous networks,"In this paper, we propose a model where two strains compete with each other at the expense of common susceptible individuals on heterogeneous networks by using pair-wise approximation closed by the probability-generating function (PGF). All of the strains obey the susceptible–infected–recovered (SIR) mechanism. From a special perspective, we first study the dynamical behaviour of an SIR model closed by the PGF, and obtain the basic reproduction number via two methods. Then we build a model to study the spreading dynamics of competing viruses and discuss the conditions for the local stability of equilibria, which is different from the condition obtained by using the heterogeneous mean-field approach. Finally, we perform numerical simulations on Barabási–Albert networks to complement our theoretical research, and show some dynamical properties of the model with competing viruses. This article is part of the themed issue ‘Mathematical methods in medicine neuroscience, cardiology and pathology’.","Despite centuries of efforts to improve public health and mitigate epidemic disease effects, the threat of infectious diseases remains. An important research method is epidemiology, with mathematical modelling as an analytical approach [1,2]. Mathematical modelling is an effective tool in understanding the spread of infectious diseases it provides the best way of translating our knowledge about the status of disease transmission at the level of contacts between individuals to a description of its spread within the community [3–6]. However, most traditional models for describing disease propagation suppose that a population is uniformly mixing, and they overlook partnerships of contacts, so these models fail to describe epidemic propagation in large-scale social contact networks with distinct heterogeneity. For most diseases, epidemic spreading through physical interactions on contact networks can be used as the as practical grounds on which to model infectious disease dynamics [7–9]. The transmission of diseases on networks is based on the major connections between people who have a link with each other, that is to say, when considering the spread of an epidemic, it is the contact structure or the links between individuals that determine the progress of the disease within the population. Thus, the key idea is that one should consider the population of dyads, rather than just individuals . Considering the ‘partnerships’ in contact on a network, pair approximation (PA) is a suitable method to depict it. Although the technique is not precise, it does capture some features of the spread. It takes into account pairs of connected individuals instead of just single individuals [11–13]. Research on pair-wise epidemic models in networks has received much attention since Matsuda applied PA to the research of population systems [14–19]. Many works have contributed to moment closure and PA, and these methods produce viable approximations to dynamics but are generally high dimensional and computationally intensive [20–25]. Volz and Miller solved this problem successively by applying the probability-generating function (PGF) to closure equations for a susceptible–infectious–recovered (SIR) model [26–30]. House and Keeling carried out further research into a new PGF moment-closure-based SIR model on heterogeneous clustered networks of heterogeneous links according to the Eames and Keeling model  and the Volz model [26,27], and then performed some numerical tests of the clustered PGF model, in contrast to simulation and other ordinary differential equation (ODE) approaches ."
PMC5485710,2017-06-26,A large-scale behavior change intervention to prevent Nipah transmission in Bangladesh: components and costs," Nipah virus infection (NiV) is a bat-borne zoonosis transmitted to humans through consumption of NiV-contaminated raw date palm sap in Bangladesh. The objective of this analysis was to measure the cost of an NiV prevention intervention and estimate the cost of scaling it up to districts where spillover had been identified. METHODS We implemented a behavior change communication intervention in two districts, testing different approaches to reduce the risk of NiV transmission using community mobilization, interpersonal communication, posters and TV public service announcements on local television during the 2012–2014 sap harvesting seasons. In one district, we implemented a “no raw sap” approach recommending to stop drinking raw date palm sap. In another district, we implemented an “only safe sap” approach, recommending to stop drinking raw date palm sap but offering the option of drinking safe sap. This is sap covered with a barrier, locally called bana, to interrupt bats’ access during collection. We conducted surveys among randomly selected respondents two months after the intervention to measure the proportion of people reached. We used an activity-based costing method to calculate the cost of the intervention. RESULTS The implementation cost of the “no raw sap” intervention was $30,000 and the “only safe sap” intervention was $55,000. The highest cost was conducting meetings and interpersonal communication efforts. The lowest cost was broadcasting the public service announcements on local TV channels. To scale up a similar intervention in 30 districts where NiV spillover has occurred, would cost between $2.6 and $3.5 million for one season. Placing the posters would cost $96,000 and only broadcasting the public service announcement through local channels in 30 districts would cost $26,000. CONCLUSIONS Broadcasting a TV public service announcement is a potential low cost option to advance NiV prevention. It could be supplemented with posters and targeted interpersonal communication, in districts with a high risk of NiV spillover. ELECTRONIC SUPPLEMENTARY MATERIAL The online version of this article (doi10.1186/s13104-017-2549-1) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.","Nipah virus (NiV) infection is a fatal emerging zoonosis that can transmit from bats to humans and can cause further person-to-person transmission [1–4]. In Bangladesh, several NiV outbreaks have been identified since 2001, and raw date palm sap consumption has been repeatedly implicated as the pathway of transmission from bats to humans [5, 6]. Raw sap is collected during cold months, from November to March, by shaving the bark near the top of the date palm tree [6, 7]. During sap collection, bats often visit date palm trees and contaminate sap with their saliva and urine [7, 8]. Interrupting bat-to-human transmission may reduce the risk of a potentially large outbreak. Based on previous pilot studies on interrupting bats access to sap [8–10], and on the Government of Bangladesh’s recommendation to abstain from drinking raw sap, we developed and implemented a behavior change communication intervention using two different approaches to reduce the risk of NiV transmission. After the intervention, local residents’ knowledge of NiV increased, and people reported changing their behavior to reduce the risk of NiV transmission through date palm sap . Thus, understanding the intervention development, process and logistics will help plan scaling it up. Calculating the approximate cost of the intervention, and the proportion of people to be reached, is useful to make investment decisions [12–14] between potential interventions to prevent not just NiV, but other emerging zoonoses."
PMC5554254,2017-08-11,Social contact patterns relevant to the spread of respiratory infectious diseases in Hong Kong,"The spread of many respiratory infections is determined by contact patterns between infectious and susceptible individuals in the population. There are no published data for quantifying social contact patterns relevant to the spread of respiratory infectious diseases in Hong Kong which is a hotspot for emerging infectious diseases due to its high population density and connectivity in the air transportation network. We adopted a commonly used diary-based design to conduct a social contact survey in Hong Kong in 2015/16 using both paper and online questionnaires. Participants using paper questionnaires reported more contacts and longer contact duration than those using online questionnaires. Participants reported 13 person-hours of contact and 8 contacts per day on average, which decreased over age but increased with household size, years of education and income level. Prolonged and frequent contacts, and contacts at home, school and work were more likely to involve physical contacts. Strong age-assortativity was observed in all age groups. We evaluated the characteristics of social contact patterns relevant to the spread of respiratory infectious diseases in Hong Kong. Our findings could help to improve the design of future social contact surveys, parameterize transmission models of respiratory infectious diseases, and inform intervention strategies based on model outputs.","Many respiratory infectious diseases are transmitted through close person-to-person contacts. Therefore, predicting infection spread and the impact of interventions such as vaccination relies on being able to quantify close contacts among individuals, particularly how different age groups mix. Consequently, large population-based surveys of social contacts targeted at understanding the spread of respiratory infections have been conducted in different populations1–22. The most common method to measure social contacts is to ask participants to report the number of contacts they make among different age groups on a given day, the proportion of contacts made in different social settings, the duration of contacts, as well as other characteristics regarded to be important for disease transmission (e.g. age, household size)1–22. These social contact data are then used to parameterize mathematical models to capture the transmission patterns of many respiratory infections, such as pertussis23, influenza12, 13, 22, 24–27, respiratory syncytial virus28 and varicella29–31. However, these data are only available in a limited number of populations such as selected European countries1, 2, 4–8, 10, 22, Japan9, Guangdong11, Taiwan14, Vietnam15, Thailand17, Peru18, Kenya19, Zambia20, Zimbabwe21 and South Africa20. Although Hong Kong is a hotspot and hub for emerging infectious diseases due to its very high population density and high connectivity in the worldwide air-transportation network32, age-specific social contact data for Hong Kong have not yet been published. A social contact survey embedded with a serological survey was conducted in Hong Kong in 200913, 33, but the age of contacts was only reported for a few age groups, and therefore it is difficult to construct customized age-specific contact matrices from the available data. Previous social contact surveys have used a variety of methods (Supplementary Table S1). Both paper and online questionnaires have been used paper questionnaires were used in all large-scale population-wide surveys; online questionnaires were first tested in a pilot survey among trained university students in Belgium in 20031 and further compared with paper questionnaires in a comparison study in Australia in 20082; in the later population-wide social contact surveys, online questionnaires were used in parallel with paper questionnaires in UK6 and as the main questionnaire mode for all age groups except the elderly aged over 65 in Japan9. Social contact data were mainly collected in two ways 1) trained interviewers completed the questionnaires by asking participants to retrospectively describe their activities during the previous day11–15, 18, 20; 2) otherwise, participants were instructed to prospectively record each contact made during the assigned day as it occurred4, 10, 16, 19, 21. It is unclear whether the mode of questionnaire type (paper vs. electronic) or the recording behaviors of participants (prospectively vs. retrospectively filling in the questionnaires) would have any substantial impact on the reported contact data, which would further affect the robustness of many modeling studies12, 13, 22–31."

We conducted a comprehensive analysis of VEE complex alphaviruses by sequencing the genomes of 94 strains and performing phylogenetic analyses of 130 isolates using complete open reading frames for the nonstructural and structural polyproteins. Our analyses confirmed purifying selection as a major mechanism influencing the evolution of these viruses as well as a confounding factor in molecular clock dating of ancestors. Times to most recent common ancestors (tMRCAs) could be robustly estimated only for the more recently diverged subtypes; the tMRCA of the ID/IAB/IC/II and IE clades of VEE virus (VEEV) were estimated at ca. 149–973 years ago. Evolution of the IE subtype has been characterized by a significant evolutionary shift from the rest of the VEEV complex, with an increase in structural protein substitutions that are unique to this group, possibly reflecting adaptation to its unique enzootic mosquito vector Culex (Melanoconion) taeniopus. Our inferred tree topologies suggest that VEEV is maintained primarily in situ, with only occasional spread to neighboring countries, probably reflecting the limited mobility of rodent hosts and mosquito vectors.","The Venezuelan equine encephalitis (VEE) antigenic complex comprises a group of alphaviruses that share similar genetic characteristics and can be defined by broad cross-reactivity antigenically  which defines them as a group within the Alphaviridae. The VEE complex alphaviruses are classified into six subtypes, designated I to VI, and consist of 9 species , of which subtype I contains the veterinary and medically important VEE virus (VEEV) (Table 1). Historically, the VEE complex subtypes I-VI were defined by serological analysis, and this nomenclature has persisted. However, the advent of sequencing resulted in several viruses now being reclassified as distinct species. For example, subtype IF is genetically distinct from the remainder of the subtype I viruses and is now classified as the species Mosso das Pedras virus. Most VEE complex viruses have enzootic cycles where they circulate between wild animals, generally rodents and mosquitoes, particularly Culex (Melanoconion) spp. mosquito vectors. With the exception of VEEV subtype II, VEE complex viruses are geographically distributed throughout Central and South America. VEEV subtype II is found only in Florida and is usually transmitted by Culex cedeci mosquitoes. The recent appearance for the first time of Culex (Melanoconion) species in southern Florida  underscores the continuing threat of emergence, possibly enhanced by climate change, which also increases the potential for other VEEV subtypes to spread northwards and establish enzootic transmission cycles. Although many VEE complex viruses have not been implicated in human disease, those that are associated with human disease (VEEV) can cause acute, often severe febrile illness that may progress to encephalitis, causing severe human morbidity and mortality . Patients who survive encephalitis are often left with permanent neurologic sequelae, and the cost for treatment and long-term care related to a single case can be several million dollars . In addition to VEEV(subtype I), which cases the majority of the encephalitis cases within the VEE subtype, subtype II Everglades virus (EVEV), which is found only in Florida, can cause neurologic disease in humans  and equids . Subtype IIIA, Mucambo virus, also causes febrile disease in humans [8, 9]. VEEV is associated with human disease, and is further subdivided into subtypes IAB, IC, ID, IE. Subtypes ID and IE comprise enzootic/endemic strains that circulate continuously in forests and swamps of northern South America, Central America and Mexico and cause a large burden of endemic disease from direct spillover . The remaining VEEV subtypes, IAB and IC, comprise epizootic/epidemic strains that are associated with periodic equine-amplified outbreaks that result in severe disease in equids and extensive spillover to humans . These outbreaks can spread from South America as far north as the southern United States [12, 13], resulting in up to hundreds-of-thousands of cases over a period of months to a few years. Prior to the 1980s, VEE epizootics involving high case-fatality rates were frequently recorded. Because horses have been an important component of the local agricultural economies within many Latin American regions, VEE has often had a sizeable economic impact as well as a direct effect on public and veterinary health . Recent outbreaks during the 1990s in Venezuela, Colombia and Mexico have demonstrated the potential for VEEV to re-emerge periodically from enzootic progenitors [15–18]. The emergence of VEEV into an epidemic/epizootic form has been associated with specific mutations that arise in the VEEV envelope glycoprotein 2 (E2) gene of enzootic subtype ID or IE strains. These mutations result in the addition of positively charged amino acid changes on the surface of the virion spikes  that give rise to increased virulence and viremia in equids [20, 21] and sometimes enhanced infection of epidemic vector mosquitoes such as Aedes (Ochlerotatus) taeniorhynchus . The higher viremia levels in equids can lead to infection of mosquitoes that are not normally involved in enzootic circulation , which can then result in spillover infections of humans and other domestic animals."
PMC5572698,2017-08-25,Methods for estimating disease transmission rates: Evaluating the precision of Poisson regression and two novel methods,"Precise estimates of disease transmission rates are critical for epidemiological simulation models. Most often these rates must be estimated from longitudinal field data, which are costly and time-consuming to conduct. Consequently, measures to reduce cost like increased sampling intervals or subsampling of the population are implemented. To assess the impact of such measures we implement two different SIS models to simulate disease transmission A simple closed population model and a realistic dairy herd including population dynamics. We analyze the accuracy of different methods for estimating the transmission rate. We use data from the two simulation models and vary the sampling intervals and the size of the population sampled. We devise two new methods to determine transmission rate, and compare these to the frequently used Poisson regression method in both epidemic and endemic situations. For most tested scenarios these new methods perform similar or better than Poisson regression, especially in the case of long sampling intervals. We conclude that transmission rate estimates are easily biased, which is important to take into account when using these rates in simulation models.","Simulation models are widely used to model spread and control of many different infectious diseases in both human and veterinary medicine1, for instance malaria2, SARS3, STDs4, influenza5, MRSA6, Ebola7, rabies8, scrapie9 and mastitis10. In these models, transmission rates are used to describe the flow of individuals in a population going from a susceptible state to an infected state, and it is important to obtain a realistic estimate of the transmission rates in order to create a useful and realistic simulation models for decision support11–13. Accurate estimation of this rate is important because it can have a major influence on model predictions and conclusions (e.g. refs11,14). The rate may have different names depending on the specific mathematical representation of transfer between susceptible and disease states, e.g. infection rate, transmission coefficient and transmission rate. This key parameter is difficult to estimate for most host-pathogen models because natural processes are stochastic, and transmission events are influenced by other parameters than what can be included in a transmission model1,15. Thus, large datasets are often needed to reach a good estimate. Experiments that can be used to estimate the transmission rate are often both difficult and time-consuming to conduct12. A means to obtain longitudinal data for estimation of the transmission rate can be to sample a subpopulation instead of the whole population, as for instance the study of Backer et al.16 where field data were used to estimate transmission rate of hepatitis E virus in pigs, subsampling down to 5% of the population. This can be the case for instance if animals must be caught prior to sampling, if the population is large, or if the test for disease is expensive17. In such situations subsampling can be a convenient method, but the precision of the estimate can be jeopardized by sampling fewer individuals. We wanted to quantify this in the present study."
PMC5594572,2017-09-11,Lessons from a decade of individual-based models for infectious disease transmission: a systematic review (2006-2015)," Individual-based models (IBMs) are useful to simulate events subject to stochasticity and/or heterogeneity, and have become well established to model the potential (re)emergence of pathogens (e.g., pandemic influenza, bioterrorism). Individual heterogeneity at the host and pathogen level is increasingly documented to influence transmission of endemic diseases and it is well understood that the final stages of elimination strategies for vaccine-preventable childhood diseases (e.g., polio, measles) are subject to stochasticity. Even so it appears IBMs for both these phenomena are not well established. We review a decade of IBM publications aiming to obtain insights in their advantages, pitfalls and rationale for use and to make recommendations facilitating knowledge transfer within and across disciplines. METHODS We systematically identified publications in Web of Science and PubMed from 2006-2015 based on title/abstract/keywords screening (and full-text if necessary) to retrieve topics, modeling purposes and general specifications. We extracted detailed modeling features from papers on established vaccine-preventable childhood diseases based on full-text screening. RESULTS We identified 698 papers, which applied an IBM for infectious disease transmission, and listed these in a reference database, describing their general characteristics. The diversity of disease-topics and overall publication frequency have increased over time (38 to 115 annual publications from 2006 to 2015). The inclusion of intervention strategies (8 to 52) and economic consequences (1 to 20) are increasing, to the detriment of purely theoretical explorations. Unfortunately, terminology used to describe IBMs is inconsistent and ambiguous. We retrieved 24 studies on a vaccine-preventable childhood disease (covering 7 different diseases), with publication frequency increasing from the first such study published in 2008. IBMs have been useful to explore heterogeneous between- and within-host interactions, but combined applications are still sparse. The amount of missing information on model characteristics and study design is remarkable. CONCLUSIONS IBMs are suited to combine heterogeneous within- and between-host interactions, which offers many opportunities, especially to analyze targeted interventions for endemic infections. We advocate the exchange of (open-source) platforms and stress the need for consistent “branding”. Using (existing) conventions and reporting protocols would stimulate cross-fertilization between research groups and fields, and ultimately policy making in decades to come.

The availability of options to control and prevent the emergence, expansion or resurgence of pathogens warrants continuous evaluation using different methods. Mathematical models provide a powerful set of tools in this process, as timely, budgetary or ethically feasible alternatives are often lacking (e.g., school closure interventions or vaccine trials to study herd immunity effects) . Even in countries or regions with high overall levels of vaccination coverage and herd immunity, sporadic outbreaks may still occur. For instance, in Europe, the flow of refugees through countries with ongoing large measles outbreaks (e.g., Bosnia-Herzegovina, Serbia) increased the risk of stochastic introduction events elsewhere . Model-based evaluations can be useful to understand the behavioral mechanisms influencing the frequency, peak and duration of these outbreaks, with the aim to design (better) strategies to prevent them or minimize their impact . Transmission dynamics of infectious diseases are usually modeled at the population-level with a compartmental model, and less frequently till now at the individual level with an individual-based model (IBM). A compartmental model tracks changes in compartments without specifying which individuals are involved . Compartmentalization typically reflects health states relevant for transmission (e.g., susceptible, infectious and recovered), though more partitioning is possible according to age and/or other relevant host characteristics. Heterogeneous and temporal behavior is modeled through incorporation of relevant time-dependent social mixing, community structures and seasonality, relevant for infectious disease dynamics [5–7]. Process dynamics are captured in transition rates, representing the rate by which an average individual transitions between compartments. IBMs work bottom-up, with population-level behavior emerging from the interactions between autonomous individuals and their environment . They allow the history of every individual to be tracked and network structures to be explicitly represented . Each individual has a unique set of attributes or state variables that can change through time including spatial location, physiological traits and/or social behavior [9, 10]. As such, IBMs allow a high degree of heterogeneity for the creation, disappearance and movement of a finite collection of discrete interacting individuals [8, 11]."
PMC5679647,2017-10-30,A mechanistic spatio-temporal framework for modelling individual-to-individual transmission—With an application to the 2014-2015 West Africa Ebola outbreak,"In recent years there has been growing availability of individual-level spatio-temporal disease data, particularly due to the use of modern communicating devices with GPS tracking functionality. These detailed data have been proven useful for inferring disease transmission to a more refined level than previously. However, there remains a lack of statistically sound frameworks to model the underlying transmission dynamic in a mechanistic manner. Such a development is particularly crucial for enabling a general epidemic predictive framework at the individual level. In this paper we propose a new statistical framework for mechanistically modelling individual-to-individual disease transmission in a landscape with heterogeneous population density. Our methodology is first tested using simulated datasets, validating our inferential machinery. The methodology is subsequently applied to data that describes a regional Ebola outbreak in Western Africa (2014-2015). Our results show that the methods are able to obtain estimates of key epidemiological parameters that are broadly consistent with the literature, while revealing a significantly shorter distance of transmission. More importantly, in contrast to existing approaches, we are able to perform a more general model prediction that takes into account the susceptible population. Finally, our results show that, given reasonable scenarios, the framework can be an effective surrogate for susceptible-explicit individual models which are often computationally challenging.","Epidemiological data collected by traditional public health surveillance often contain relatively coarse spatial and temporal information on infected individuals. In recent years, the amount and resolution of the spatio-temporal data have increased vastly due to the advent of ‘digital epidemiology’ along with the increased use of modern communication devices , particularly through the use of mobile phones which drastically improves the tracking of human contacts [2–4]. Such data provide unprecedented opportunities for dissecting disease spread at a more localized, individual-to-individual level. The recent West Africa Ebola outbreak (Fig 1) well demonstrated the increasing availability of such data, and, in particular, the GPS location data collected during the outbreak have been shown to be useful in identifying superspreaders and quantifying the impact of superspreading during the outbreak . However, the growing availability of these more precise spatio-temporal data has not been accompanied by development of statistically sound mechanistic frameworks for modelling the underlying individual-to-individual transmission process. Developing such methods is an essential step for systematically extracting maximal information from such data, in particular, evaluating the efficacy of individually-targeted control strategies and enabling forward epidemic prediction at the individual level."
PMC5708841,2017-11-10,Autophagy pathway induced by a plant virus facilitates viral spread and transmission by its insect vector,"Many viral pathogens are persistently transmitted by insect vectors and cause agricultural or health problems. Generally, an insect vector can use autophagy as an intrinsic antiviral defense mechanism against viral infection. Whether viruses can evolve to exploit autophagy to promote their transmission by insect vectors is still unknown. Here, we show that the autophagic process is triggered by the persistent replication of a plant reovirus, rice gall dwarf virus (RGDV) in cultured leafhopper vector cells and in intact insects, as demonstrated by the appearance of obvious virus-containing double-membrane autophagosomes, conversion of ATG8-I to ATG8-II and increased level of autophagic flux. Such virus-containing autophagosomes seem able to mediate nonlytic viral release from cultured cells or facilitate viral spread in the leafhopper intestine. Applying the autophagy inhibitor 3-methyladenine or silencing the expression of Atg5 significantly decrease viral spread in vitro and in vivo, whereas applying the autophagy inducer rapamycin or silencing the expression of Torc1 facilitate such viral spread. Furthermore, we find that activation of autophagy facilitates efficient viral transmission, whereas inhibiting autophagy blocks viral transmission by its insect vector. Together, these results indicate a plant virus can induce the formation of autophagosomes for carrying virions, thus facilitating viral spread and transmission by its insect vector. We believe that such a role for virus-induced autophagy is common for vector-borne persistent viruses during their transmission by insect vectors.","Many viral pathogens that cause significant global health and agricultural problems are transmitted via insect vectors. To maximize transmission efficiency, viruses generally can modulate the biology and behavior of their vectors [1, 2]. Many arthropod-borne animal viruses (arboviruses) and plant viruses have evolved to be well adapted for persistent infection and maintenance in their insect vectors and may have some characteristics of insect pathogens [1, 2]. Such viruses circulate in the insect body and induce a variety of cellular responses that modulate the efficiency of viral transmission [2, 3]. However, the detailed mechanisms underlying the cellular responses induced by viral infection in insect vectors are poorly understood. In mammals, viral infection can induce or activate autophagy, an important cellular response, which generally plays an important role against viruses [4, 5]. Autophagy is a highly conserved catabolic process that mediates the clearance of long-lived proteins and damaged organelles via a lysosomal degradative pathway [6, 7]. The mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling pathways has been shown to control autophagy [9, 10]. These factors work in coordination to regulate autophagy, including the formation of autophagosomes and their fusion with lysosomes . Under normal conditions, autophagy proceeds at a basal level, but it is significantly activated in response to a variety of stimuli, such as viral infection, nutrient starvation, and energy depletion [4, 11]. Although autophagy commonly serves as a defense mechanism against viral infection, some viruses appear to have evolved to exploit this mechanism to promote their survival and replication in different ways [12–23]. Thus, the role of autophagy in host-virus interactions is diverse for different viruses."
PMC5710062,2017-12-01,Potential for broad-scale transmission of Ebola virus disease during the West Africa crisis: lessons for the Global Health security agenda," The 2014–2016 Ebola crisis in West Africa had approximately eight times as many reported deaths as the sum of all previous Ebola outbreaks. The outbreak magnitude and occurrence of multiple Ebola cases in at least seven countries beyond Liberia, Sierra Leone, and Guinea, hinted at the possibility of broad-scale transmission of Ebola. MAIN TEXT Using a modeling tool developed by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention during the Ebola outbreak, we estimated the number of Ebola cases that might have occurred had the disease spread beyond the three countries in West Africa to cities in other countries at high risk for disease transmission (based on late 2014 air travel patterns). We estimated Ebola cases in three scenarios a delayed response, a Liberia-like response, and a fast response scenario. Based on our estimates of the number of Ebola cases that could have occurred had Ebola spread to other countries beyond the West African foci, we emphasize the need for improved levels of preparedness and response to public health threats, which is the goal of the Global Health Security Agenda. Our estimates suggest that Ebola could have potentially spread widely beyond the West Africa foci, had local and international health workers and organizations not committed to a major response effort. Our results underscore the importance of rapid detection and initiation of an effective, organized response, and the challenges faced by countries with limited public health systems. Actionable lessons for strengthening local public health systems in countries at high risk of disease transmission include increasing health personnel, bolstering primary and critical healthcare facilities, developing public health infrastructure (e.g. laboratory capacity), and improving disease surveillance. With stronger local public health systems infectious disease outbreaks would still occur, but their rapid escalation would be considerably less likely, minimizing the impact of public health threats such as Ebola. CONCLUSIONS The Ebola outbreak could have potentially spread to other countries, where limited public health surveillance and response capabilities may have resulted in additional foci. Health security requires robust local health systems that can rapidly detect and effectively respond to an infectious disease outbreak. ELECTRONIC SUPPLEMENTARY MATERIAL The online version of this article (10.1186/s40249-017-0373-4) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.","Please see Additional file 1 for translation of the abstract into the six official working languages of the United Nations. The 2014–2016 Ebola crisis in West Africa was unprecedented in scale, with about 28652 suspected, probable, or confirmed Ebola cases (15261 cases were laboratory confirmed), and 11,325 deaths [1, 2]. All previous outbreaks combined (1976–2008) resulted in 2232 reported Ebola cases and 1503 reported deaths . The response effort by local and international health workers and organizations resulted in control of the Ebola outbreak in West Africa by the end of 2015, but not without significant costs for both donor and afflicted countries . By December 2015, the response had cost donors at least US$ 3.6 billion ; an additional estimated US$ 2.2 billion in gross domestic product (GDP) were lost in Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone in 2015. More than 17,300 children lost one or both parents to Ebola . Furthermore, access to healthcare services decreased substantially, resulting in a considerable hidden morbidity and mortality burden [4, 5]."
PMC5727041,2017-12-12,Comparative epidemiology of poliovirus transmission,"Understanding the determinants of polio transmission and its large-scale epidemiology remains a public health priority. Despite a 99% reduction in annual wild poliovirus (WPV) cases since 1988, tackling the last 1% has proven difficult. We identified key covariates of geographical variation in polio transmission patterns by relating country-specific annual disease incidence to demographic, socio-economic and environmental factors. We assessed the relative contributions of these variables to the performance of computer-generated models for predicting polio transmission. We also examined the effect of spatial coupling on the polio extinction frequency in islands relative to larger land masses. Access to sanitation, population density, forest cover and routine vaccination coverage were the strongest predictors of polio incidence, however their relative effect sizes were inconsistent geographically. The effect of climate variables on polio incidence was negligible, indicating that a climate effect is not identifiable at the annual scale, suggesting a role for climate in shaping the transmission seasonality rather than intensity. We found polio fadeout frequency to depend on both population size and demography, which should therefore be considered in policies aimed at extinction. Our comparative epidemiological approach highlights the heterogeneity among polio transmission determinants. Recognition of this variation is important for the maintenance of population immunity in a post-polio era.","During the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, poliomyelitis, an acute viral disease, caused the paralysis of hundreds of thousands of children1. The introduction and widespread use of effective vaccines in the 1950 s and 1960 s led to a dramatic reduction in polio-related Acute Flaccid Paralysis (AFP). Since the launch of the Global Polio Eradication Initiative (GPEI) in 1988, more than 2.5 billion children have been vaccinated with a corresponding decline of over 99% in the annual wild poliovirus (WPV) incidence2. Despite this impressive progress, tackling the last one percent of polio cases has been challenging3. In addition to the failure to reach pockets of unvaccinated children due to conflict, religious beliefs and social upheaval4, other factors might help virus circulate in the environment5, but their effects are poorly understood. The large scale geographic variation in incidence and frequent historical spillover of WPV from regional strongholds to countries believed to be polio-free highlight the urgent need to identify local conditions conducive to ongoing transmission6. An understanding of the covariates of poliovirus incidence is also important for risk management in countries that have been declared disease-free. Human infectious diseases display striking biogeographic patterns at a global scale7, which may often be explained by demographic, environmental, and socioeconomic factors. Often, these patterns contain the clues needed to identify key risk factors. Assessing the variation in the magnitude of disease outbreaks and their geographic consistency with respect to these factors–an approach referred to as spatial epidemiology
8–is necessary for characterizing infectious disease dynamics at the global scale5,9,10. In recent years, spatial epidemiology has been used to explore the dynamics of SARS11, whooping cough12, foot-and-mouth disease13, rotavirus14, pandemic influenza15, and polio16. Studies of polio, however, have focused almost exclusively on vaccination policies, using either predictive statistical models17–19 or dynamic models of transmission20,21. A quantified picture of regional disease patterns and their spatially extended macroecological determinants is still missing. To bridge this gap, we performed a comparative study, investigating a wide range of potential predictors of polio incidence at the national level. We were particularly interested in identifying the drivers of poliovirus persistence in the environment. Our results show that there is not a singular “polio epidemiology” or social syndrome hampering elimination, but rather that the conditions supporting persistence vary from place to place and require local knowledge to identify and overcome."
PMC5745403,2017-12-20,Infections on the move: how transient phases of host movement influence disease spread,"Animal movement impacts the spread of human and wildlife diseases, and there is significant interest in understanding the role of migrations, biological invasions and other wildlife movements in spatial infection dynamics. However, the influence of processes acting on infections during transient phases of host movement is poorly understood. We propose a conceptual framework that explicitly considers infection dynamics during transient phases of host movement to better predict infection spread through spatial host networks. Accounting for host transient movement captures key processes that occur while hosts move between locations, which together determine the rate at which hosts spread infections through networks. We review theoretical and empirical studies of host movement and infection spread, highlighting the multiple factors that impact the infection status of hosts. We then outline characteristics of hosts, parasites and the environment that influence these dynamics. Recent technological advances provide disease ecologists unprecedented ability to track the fine-scale movement of organisms. These, in conjunction with experimental testing of the factors driving infection dynamics during host movement, can inform models of infection spread based on constituent biological processes.","Understanding how infectious diseases spread through spatial networks of hosts has been called a ‘holy grail' of epidemiology . Spatial host networks portray host populations as a set of nodes in which hosts reside, and host movement among those locations serves as the links (i.e. edges) connecting the network [2,3]. As most disease-causing parasites cannot actively disperse, host movement also provides critical links for parasite infections to spread . Characterizing these links is not straightforward, however. Multiple processes act on hosts during movement across the landscape that potentially influence infections. Dispersal ecologists refer to this period of movement after organisms depart a discrete location (e.g. household, habitat patch), but before arriving to a different location, as the transient phase . Explicitly considering transient movement phases has provided a deeper understanding of the causes and consequences of wildlife movement , but this phase has largely been ignored in studies of disease spread. Moving hosts are subject to changes in biotic and abiotic conditions that alter existing infections , cause mortality [6,7] or facilitate acquisition of new infections [8,9]. The infection status of individuals arriving into new locations may therefore be indirectly or unrelated to their infection status when movement is initiated. Here, we review the limitations of current approaches to studying infection spread and emphasize the benefits of explicitly considering the processes that occur during transient phases of host movement (hereafter referred to as ‘host transience'). First, we overview the existing methods examining the link between host movement and infection spread. Second, we propose a modelling framework that explicitly considers host movement and infection dynamics during transient phases, before developing testable hypotheses about the importance of factors influencing infection dynamics during host transience. We conclude by discussing how our framework can guide future research testing the role of host transience in the spatio-temporal dynamics of wildlife and human disease."
PMC5807439,2018-02-09,Far-UVC light: A new tool to control the spread of airborne-mediated microbial diseases,"Airborne-mediated microbial diseases such as influenza and tuberculosis represent major public health challenges. A direct approach to prevent airborne transmission is inactivation of airborne pathogens, and the airborne antimicrobial potential of UVC ultraviolet light has long been established; however, its widespread use in public settings is limited because conventional UVC light sources are both carcinogenic and cataractogenic. By contrast, we have previously shown that far-UVC light (207–222 nm) efficiently inactivates bacteria without harm to exposed mammalian skin. This is because, due to its strong absorbance in biological materials, far-UVC light cannot penetrate even the outer (non living) layers of human skin or eye; however, because bacteria and viruses are of micrometer or smaller dimensions, far-UVC can penetrate and inactivate them. We show for the first time that far-UVC efficiently inactivates airborne aerosolized viruses, with a very low dose of 2 mJ/cm of 222-nm light inactivating >95% of aerosolized H1N1 influenza virus. Continuous very low dose-rate far-UVC light in indoor public locations is a promising, safe and inexpensive tool to reduce the spread of airborne-mediated microbial diseases.","Airborne-mediated microbial diseases represent one of the major challenges to worldwide public health1. Common examples are influenza2, appearing in seasonal3 and pandemic4 forms, and bacterially-based airborne-mediated diseases such as tuberculosis5, increasingly emerging in multi-drug resistant form. A direct approach to prevent the transmission of airborne-mediated disease is inactivation of the corresponding airborne pathogens, and in fact the airborne antimicrobial efficacy of ultraviolet (UV) light has long been established6–8. Germicidal UV light can also efficiently inactivate both drug-sensitive and multi-drug-resistant bacteria9, as well as differing strains of viruses10. However, the widespread use of germicidal ultraviolet light in public settings has been very limited because conventional UVC light sources are a human health hazard, being both carcinogenic and cataractogenic11,12."
PMC5846056,2018-03-06,Health-seeking behavior and transmission dynamics in the control of influenza infection among different age groups," It has been found that health-seeking behavior has a certain impact on influenza infection. However, behaviors with/without risk perception on the control of influenza transmission among age groups have not been well quantified. OBJECTIVES The purpose of this study was to assess to what extent, under scenarios of with/without control and preventive/protective behaviors, the age-specific network-driven risk perception influences influenza infection. MATERIALS AND METHODS A behavior-influenza model was used to estimate the spread rate of age-specific risk perception in response to an influenza outbreak. A network-based information model was used to assess the effect of network-driven risk perception information transmission on influenza infection. A probabilistic risk model was used to assess the infection risk effect of risk perception with a health behavior change. RESULTS The age-specific overlapping percentage was estimated to be 40%–43%, 55%–60%, and 19%–35% for child, teenage and adult, and elderly age groups, respectively. Individuals perceive the preventive behavior to improve risk perception information transmission among teenage and adult and elderly age groups, but not in the child age group. The population with perceived health behaviors could not effectively decrease the percentage of infection risk in the child age group, whereas for the elderly age group, the percentage of decrease in infection risk was more significant, with a 97.5th percentile estimate of 97%. CONCLUSION The present integrated behavior-infection model can help health authorities in communicating health messages for an intertwined belief network in which health-seeking behavior plays a key role in controlling influenza infection.","It has been found that health-seeking behavior has a certain impact on influenza infection.1 Therefore, to facilitate public health decisions about intervention and management in controlling the spread of infectious diseases, it is crucial to assess to what extent, under scenarios of with/without control and preventive/protective behaviors, the age-specific network-driven risk perception influences influenza infection.2 To control respiratory infectious diseases, the development of vaccination, contact tracing, isolation, and the promotion of protective behaviors are the important measures. Indeed, the effectiveness of control measures fundamentally depends greatly on human beliefs on public infection awareness and risk perception for driving the change in self-behavior.3 Risk perception can be referred to as an awareness or belief about the potential hazard and/or harm, which plays an important role in shaping health-related behaviors to reducing susceptibility and infectivity.4 Generally, risk perception is affected by social factors such as media release by health authorities, observation or interaction with relation-specific groups, past experiences of similar hazards, habits, and culture.5 These factors result in variation in risk perception among individuals."
PMC6018772,2018-06-26,Estimating spatiotemporally varying malaria reproduction numbers in a near elimination setting,"In 2016 the World Health Organization identified 21 countries that could eliminate malaria by 2020. Monitoring progress towards this goal requires tracking ongoing transmission. Here we develop methods that estimate individual reproduction numbers and their variation through time and space. Individual reproduction numbers, R(c), describe the state of transmission at a point in time and differ from mean reproduction numbers, which are averages of the number of people infected by a typical case. We assess elimination progress in El Salvador using data for confirmed cases of malaria from 2010 to 2016. Our results demonstrate that whilst the average number of secondary malaria cases was below one (0.61, 95% CI 0.55–0.65), individual reproduction numbers often exceeded one. We estimate a decline in R(c) between 2010 and 2016. However we also show that if importation is maintained at the same rate, the country may not achieve malaria elimination by 2020.","Great strides have been made since 2000 in reducing the burden and mortality of malaria. The World Health Organisation (WHO) estimates that 57 out of the 106 countries with endemic malaria transmission in 2000 reduced their incidence of malaria by >75% between 2000 and 20151. As a result, malaria elimination at the national level, defined as the absence of local transmission within a country2, is now one of the targets in the WHO Global Strategy for Malaria 2016–20303. In 2016 the WHO identified 21 countries for which it would be realistic to eliminate malaria within the next five years4. As countries attempt to move towards malaria elimination, tracking progress through quantifying changes in transmission over space and time is key. This information is necessary to effectively target resources to remaining ‘hotspots’ and ‘hotpops’5 where transmission remains, decide if and when it is appropriate to scale back interventions, and to evaluate the success of existing interventions. However, as countries approach zero cases, increasing focality in transmission and the impact of imported cases pose challenges to both reaching elimination6 and measuring progress towards that goal. Increased spatial and temporal heterogeneity in malaria cases7–9 in low transmission settings reduces the usefulness of national or regional level trends in incidence or prevalence, which can mask small areas of high transmission intensity. Furthermore, end-game surveillance and control measures are increasingly expensive per case. Therefore, while interventions must be targeted efficiently to be cost-effective7,8,10, the identity of areas driving remaining transmission and their stability over time are poorly understood."
PMC6058931,2018-06-25,"Expanding Patient Access to Investigational New Drugs: Overview of Intermediate and Widespread Treatment Investigational New Drugs, and Emergency Authorization in Public Health Emergencies","Individual patients with life-threatening or severely debilitating diseases can petition the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) through their physicians to have expanded access (EA) to drugs that are in clinical trials but have not reached full FDA approval (the “single-patient” investigational new drug [IND] application). Additionally, recent state and federal laws—so-called “right to try legislation”—allow patients to approach drug companies directly for access prior to FDA approval. While these pathways provide potential access for individual patients to investigational drugs, different EA pathways permit entire groups of certain patients to access investigational drugs prior to FDA approval. This review focuses on special categories of EA INDs intended for multiple patients—the intermediate-group IND and the widespread-treatment IND—as well as emergency authorization for use of investigational drugs and biological products (e.g., vaccines) in public health emergencies.","Releasing investigational new drugs to individual patients who are facing certain death or disability seems to be a relatively uncomplicated decision, but allowing EA to entire groups of patients for treatment with an investigational new drug presents more complex regulatory, logistical, and ethical challenges for scientists, commercial entities, and the FDA. The current regulatory process from IND filing to drug approval has evolved and includes not only the FDA’s historical primary mission of ensuring patient safety, but also, since the latter half of the 20th century, the newer mission of ensuring that marketed drugs are actually efficacious for their advertised/approved use. EA for a single patient may not present much of a challenge to the assertion that a drug’s benefits outweigh the risks, because as presumably the patient requesting compassionate use faces an otherwise dismal clinical future, taking even significant risks with a new drug still presents potential benefits to a patient without other options. Early in a drug’s regulatory pathway, however, it is not usually possible to ensure that a drug has a reasonable risk/benefit ratio for all patients, including those in the early stages of disease. Drug companies face bigger issues when the seeker of EA is a group of patients or an entire class of patients. Before marketing, manufacture of the drug for clinical studies is nearly an “all cost” proposition for the commercial entity; the drug cannot be marketed to cover its costs. Thus, companies generally only manufacture sufficient quantities (plus a small margin) to cover the requirements of clinical studies, rather than devote resources to manufacturing large quantities of a drug which has a <10% chance of ever making it to market 1, 2. The FDA approval process begins with the filing of an investigational new drug (IND). Making the drug available to groups or classes of patients who might then deplete the supply of drug for clinical studies could compromise the very research that would more completely disclose a drug’s risks and benefits; thus, it could possibly impede full market approval that would make the drug more widely available."
PMC6096730,2018-07-19,Microglia control the spread of neurotropic virus infection via P2Y12 signalling and recruit monocytes through P2Y12-independent mechanisms,"Neurotropic herpesviruses can establish lifelong infection in humans and contribute to severe diseases including encephalitis and neurodegeneration. However, the mechanisms through which the brain’s immune system recognizes and controls viral infections propagating across synaptically linked neuronal circuits have remained unclear. Using a well-established model of alphaherpesvirus infection that reaches the brain exclusively via retrograde transsynaptic spread from the periphery, and in vivo two-photon imaging combined with high resolution microscopy, we show that microglia are recruited to and isolate infected neurons within hours. Selective elimination of microglia results in a marked increase in the spread of infection and egress of viral particles into the brain parenchyma, which are associated with diverse neurological symptoms. Microglia recruitment and clearance of infected cells require cell-autonomous P2Y12 signalling in microglia, triggered by nucleotides released from affected neurons. In turn, we identify microglia as key contributors to monocyte recruitment into the inflamed brain, which process is largely independent of P2Y12. P2Y12-positive microglia are also recruited to infected neurons in the human brain during viral encephalitis and both microglial responses and leukocyte numbers correlate with the severity of infection. Thus, our data identify a key role for microglial P2Y12 in defence against neurotropic viruses, whilst P2Y12-independent actions of microglia may contribute to neuroinflammation by facilitating monocyte recruitment to the sites of infection. ELECTRONIC SUPPLEMENTARY MATERIAL The online version of this article (10.1007/s00401-018-1885-0) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.","Microglia are the main immunocompetent cell type of the brain that play a role in diverse physiological processes, including brain development, synaptic plasticity and memory. In turn, alterations in microglial function are linked with common brain diseases such as stroke, epilepsy, Alzheimer’s or Parkinson’s disease [3, 28, 47, 63]. But how microglial actions determine the fate of individual neurons remained largely unclear to date. Microglia are capable of removing synapses via complement-mediated manner [26, 59] and eliminate injured neurons via recognising translocated phosphatidylserine on the cell membrane . Numerous mediators including chemokines, metalloproteinases, growth factors, purinergic metabolites, alarmins or damage-associated molecular patterns such as HMGB1, histones and DNA have been revealed as indicators of neuronal injury and triggers for microglial activation [9, 29, 30, 57, 58]. Among these, microglial P2Y12 receptor-mediated actions have been shown to facilitate the movement of microglial processes to sites of injury or ATP administration [14, 25], whilst constant microglial surveillance of the brain was found to be largely P2Y12-independent [39, 53]. However, whether microglial P2Y12 is involved in early recognition and clearance of injured neurons independently of mediating generic microglial actions to tissue injury remained unclear. One of the major difficulties in studying microglial responses to mediators released from stressed neurons in vivo is the immediate response of surveilling microglia to any noxious stimuli , which is an inherent confounder of most experimental models that include manipulation in the brain parenchyma. To overcome these difficulties, we took advantage of the genetically modified strains of pseudorabies virus (PRV), a member of the subfamily Alphaherpesvirinae (similar to human herpes simplex virus type 1 or varicella-zoster virus), widely used for neuroanatomical tract-tracing and as a well-established model of neurotropic virus infection [6, 8]. When injected into peripheral organs, the “Bartha-Dup” strains of PRV display slow and highly specific retrograde transsynaptic spread in central autonomic circuits , allowing us to study directed microglial recruitment in parallel with the propagation of virus infection in the brain using in vivo imaging and advanced histological approaches. Since in this model microglia may only sense signals identifying affected neurons in their vicinity, but do not become infected with PRV even under ex vivo conditions unlike in the case of most viruses with potential or preferential neurotropism in vivo [6, 50], we could also investigate the functional role of microglia and microglial P2Y12 receptors in the control of infection together with the associated neuroinflammatory response."
PMC6107991,2018-10-01,Population Serologic Immunity to Human and Avian H2N2 Viruses in the United States and Hong Kong for Pandemic Risk Assessment," Influenza A pandemics cause significant mortality and morbidity. H2N2 viruses have caused a prior pandemic, and are circulating in avian reservoirs. The age-related frequency of current population immunity to H2 viruses was evaluated. METHODS Hemagglutinin inhibition (HAI) assays against historical human and recent avian influenza A(H2N2) viruses were performed across age groups in Rochester, New York, and Hong Kong, China. The impact of existing cross-reactive HAI immunity on the effective reproduction number was modeled. RESULTS One hundred fifty individual sera from Rochester and 295 from Hong Kong were included. Eighty-five percent of patients born in Rochester and Hong Kong before 1968 had HAI titers ≥140 against A/Singapore/1/57, and >50% had titers ≥140 against A/Berkeley/1/68. The frequency of titers ≥140 to avian H2N2 A/mallard/England/727/06 and A/mallard/Netherlands/14/07 in subjects born before 1957 was 62% and 24%, respectively. There were no H2 HAI titers >140 in individuals born after 1968. These levels of seroprevalence reduce the initial reproduction number of A/Singapore/1/1957 or A/Berkeley/1/68 by 15%–20%. A basic reproduction number (R) of the emerging transmissible virus <1.2 predicts a preventable pandemic. CONCLUSIONS Population immunity to H2 viruses is insufficient to block epidemic spread of H2 virus. An H2N2 pandemic would have lower impact in those born before 1968.","Samples in Rochester were collected between 18 January 2010 and 14 March 2014 from nonimmunosuppressed individuals who were healthy or had stable medical conditions and were from 6 months to 80 years of age. In the United States, influenza activity typically peaks in January or February. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, in 2010–2011 influenza activity peaked in early February and in 2011–2012 it remained low through February and did not peak until mid-March. In 2012–2013, 2013–2014, and 2014–2015, influenza activity peaked in late December with some variability . Sera from children and adults in Hong Kong were collected as part of a previous serological study between 24 August 24 and 19 December 2011, prior to the winter influenza season, which typically commences around February–March in Hong Kong . The preceding influenza season peaked in February–March 2011 and the dominant virus subtype was pandemic H1N1. Two hundred ninety-five serum samples from this study were selected for testing in age strata."
PMC6110518,2018-08-15,Accounting for non-stationarity in epidemiology by embedding time-varying parameters in stochastic models,"The spread of disease through human populations is complex. The characteristics of disease propagation evolve with time, as a result of a multitude of environmental and anthropic factors, this non-stationarity is a key factor in this huge complexity. In the absence of appropriate external data sources, to correctly describe the disease propagation, we explore a flexible approach, based on stochastic models for the disease dynamics, and on diffusion processes for the parameter dynamics. Using such a diffusion process has the advantage of not requiring a specific mathematical function for the parameter dynamics. Coupled with particle MCMC, this approach allows us to reconstruct the time evolution of some key parameters (average transmission rate for instance). Thus, by capturing the time-varying nature of the different mechanisms involved in disease propagation, the epidemic can be described. Firstly we demonstrate the efficiency of this methodology on a toy model, where the parameters and the observation process are known. Applied then to real datasets, our methodology is able, based solely on simple stochastic models, to reconstruct complex epidemics, such as flu or dengue, over long time periods. Hence we demonstrate that time-varying parameters can improve the accuracy of model performances, and we suggest that our methodology can be used as a first step towards a better understanding of a complex epidemic, in situation where data is limited and/or uncertain.","Our approach is based on three main components an epidemiological model embedded in a state-space framework, a diffusion process for each time-varying parameter and an up-to-date Bayesian inference technique based on adaptive PMCMC. The main advantage of the state-space framework is the use of two sets of equations, the first set describes the propagation of the disease in the population and the second is for the observation process. This allows for consideration of unknowns and uncertainty both in the epidemiological mechanisms and in the partial observation of the disease

PMC6116215,2018-08-18,Shell-Less Egg Syndrome (SES) Widespread in Western Canadian Layer Operations Is Linked to a Massachusetts (Mass) Type Infectious Bronchitis Virus (IBV) Isolate,"A disease with a sudden drop in egg production and shell-less eggs called, shell-less egg syndrome (SES) has been observed in Western Canada egg layer flocks since 2010. The etiology of this disease is not known. We hypothesize that SES is caused by an infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) strain since it is known that IBV replicates in the shell gland causing various eggshell abnormalities. In this study, we screened egg layer flocks, in the provinces of Alberta (AB) and Saskatchewan (SK), with and without a history of SES for the presence of IBV infection. During 2015–2016, a total of 27 egg layer flocks were screened in AB (n = 7) and SK (n = 20). Eighty-one percent of the screened flocks (n = 22) were positive for IBV infection. Thirty of these isolates were successfully characterized using molecular tools targeting the most variable spike (S) 1 gene. IBV isolates from this study clustered into three genotypes based on partial S1 gene variability. The majority of the IBV isolates (70%) were Massachusetts (Mass) type, and the rest were either Connecticut (Conn) type or an uncharacterized genotype with genetic characteristics of Mass and Conn types. Since the majority of the IBV isolates included within the Mass type, we used a Mass type IBV isolate to reproduce SES in specific pathogen free (SPF) white leghorn chickens in lay. Further studies are warranted to investigate whether other IBV isolates can cause SES, to clarify the pathogenesis of SES and to develop a vaccine in order to prevent SES as observed in Western Canadian layer flocks.","Since 2010 an increasing number of observations of transient shell-less egg production in layer operations located in Saskatchewan (SK), Canada was reported, and recently, this was also reported in Manitoba and Alberta (AB). These are sporadic outbreaks in layers of varying ages, during lay and affected flocks generally show a drop in egg production in addition to the production of shell-less eggs. This condition is known as “shell-less egg syndrome” (SES) and is thought to be caused by a strain of IBV since some strains of IBV are known to target the shell gland of the reproductive tract where the shell of the egg is formed . IBV is known to cause egg-shell abnormalities in layers including soft thin shells , distorted shells , and discolored shells . Egg production in laying chicken can be affected by a number of avian viruses including hepatitis E virus, Newcastle disease virus (NDV), low pathogenic avian influenza virus (LPAIV), avian encephalomyelitis virus (AEV), infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), and egg drop syndrome virus (EDSV). All these viruses except AEV can affect the internal and external quality of eggs [1,4,5,6,7,8,9,10] and only EDSV can lead to shell-less egg production under natural and experimental situations [10,11,12,13]. Notably, also IBV can replicate in various body compartments and organs [1,14,15], including the shell gland, causing various eggshell abnormalities, reduced egg production, and quality depending on the age at lay and the strain of the virus [9,14,16]."
PMC6175510,2018-10-08,Monitoring the age-specificity of measles transmissions during 2009-2016 in Southern China," Despite several immunization efforts, China saw a resurgence of measles in 2012. Monitoring of transmissions of individuals from different age groups could offer information that would be valuable for planning adequate disease control strategies. We compared the age-specific effective reproductive numbers (R) of measles during 2009–2016 in Guangdong, China. METHODS We estimated the age-specific R values for 7 age groups 0–8 months, 9–18 months, 19 months to 6 years, 7–15 years, 16–25 years, 26–45 years, and ≥46 years adapting the contact matrix of China. The daily numbers of laboratory and clinically confirmed cases reported to the Center for Disease Control and Prevention of Guangdong were used. RESULTS The peak R values of the entire population were above unity from 2012 to 2016, indicating the persistence of measles in the population. In general, children aged 0–6 years and adults aged 26–45 years had larger values of R when comparing with other age groups after 2012. While the peaks of R values for children aged 0–6 years dropped steadily after 2013, the peaks of R values for adults aged 26–45 years kept at a high range every year. CONCLUSIONS Although the provincial supplementary immunization activities (SIAs) conducted in 2009 and 2010 were able to reduce the transmissions from 2009 to 2011, larger values of R for children aged 0–6 years were observed after 2012, indicating that the benefits of the SIAs were short-lived. In addition, the transmissions from adults aged between 26 and 45 years increased over time. Disease control strategies should target children and adult groups that carry high potential for measles transmission.","Measles is a highly contagious acute viral disease. Throughout the world, and most countries have set goals for its elimination. In 1978, the national Expanded Program on Immunization (EPI) in China started to implement a standard schedule for the routine administration of one dose of measles-containing vaccine (MCV1) among children between 8 and 24 months of age. Subsequently, the mean annual measles incidence decreased from 355 per 100,000 in 1970–1979 to 53 per 100,000 in 1980–1989 . In 1986, a two-dose routine measles immunization program was implemented for children aged between 8 months and 7 years. The age schedule for the second dose of MCV (MCV2) was shifted to 18–24 months in 2005. During 2000–2009, the number of measles cases showed a remarkable decrease but remained around 6.8 per 100,000 on average . In 2006, the government of China set a goal to eliminate measles by 2012, for which purpose a series of programs was implemented, including strengthening routine immunization surveillance, supplementary immunization activities (SIAs), and case-based surveillance . An SIA is defined as the administration of a supplementary dose of a vaccine to a specific age population in a certain area during a short period, regardless of the recipients' previous vaccination histories. SIAs enhance routine immunization programs, including catch-up campaigns, follow-up campaigns, and outbreak-response immunization. The estimated coverage rate of routine immunization with MCV1 increased from 80.4% in 2000 to 91.1% in 2009, whereas the estimated coverage rate for MCV2 was <80% before 2005 and 84.3% in 2009 . In September 2010, China conducted a synchronized, nationwide SIA that targeted children aged 8 months to 14 years, covering 102 million children with a reported coverage rate of 97.5% [1–3]. Although the annual measles incidence had dropped to 0.46 per 100,000 in 2012, it resurged to more than 1.96 per 100,000 in 2013 . Despite the implementation of two-dose routine vaccines since 2005, frequent outbreaks have occurred over the past years [4–6]. Guangdong, a highly populated province with 108 million population in 2015, is located in the southernmost part of mainland China (Fig 1). The incidence of measles in Guangdong dropped to a remarkable low in 2011 (0.30/100,000) after a series of SIAs targeting children aged 8 months to 14 years during 2009 and 2010. However, Guangdong had the highest number of reported cases in China in 2012 and 2013, with incidences of 1.84 and 6.64 per 100,000, respectively , even though the reported coverage of MCVs was kept above 98% every year after 2009. To this end, the Guangdong government implemented some mop-up vaccination programs after 2012 targeting children aged 8 months to 6 years (Fig 1)."
PMC6195814,2018-05-03,Epidemic spreading in localized environments with recurrent mobility patterns,"The spreading of epidemics is very much determined by the structure of the contact network, which may be impacted by the mobility dynamics of the individuals themselves. In confined scenarios where a small, closed population spends most of its time in localized environments and has easily identifiable mobility patterns—such as workplaces, university campuses, or schools—it is of critical importance to identify the factors controlling the rate of disease spread. Here, we present a discrete-time, metapopulation-based model to describe the transmission of susceptible-infected-susceptible-like diseases that take place in confined scenarios where the mobilities of the individuals are not random but, rather, follow clear recurrent travel patterns. This model allows analytical determination of the onset of epidemics, as well as the ability to discern which contact structures are most suited to prevent the infection to spread. It thereby determines whether common prevention mechanisms, as isolation, are worth implementing in such a scenario and their expected impact.","The spreading of infectious diseases is strongly dependent on the networked structure of interactions in the population [1,2] and on the mobility of individuals [3–7]. A particularly interesting scenario is that where the structure of the social contacts of the individuals is not completely well mixed nor completely structured, but offers an intermediate level of description. These kinds of models are usually referred to as metapopulation models [8–11] and were first used in the field of population ecology [12–15]. In such settings, the nodes of the network represent a population, which is occupied by individuals, and the links of the network represent the migration of individuals from one population to another. This scenario is particularly useful in the study of the spreading of epidemics, given that many real-life patterns of interactions happen in structured, localized populations connected by some degree of migration. The populations usually describe small, local environments (e.g., a city, a college dormitory, or an office, depending on the application) where it is plausible to assume that every individual in the population is able to contact any other individual inside the same location with some probability. The underlying network structure (i.e., the links between subpopulations) describes the mobility patterns of individuals among locations, and can be weighted and/or directed. The problem of modeling such scenarios relies on finding the appropriate level of abstraction to grasp the main macroscopic features of the epidemic spreading process for individuals across the particular environment. The analysis of these oversimplified model abstractions is of utmost importance to separate the effect of single parameters on the incidence of the spreading process, yet allowing an analytical approach that could be used for prediction purposes and to test prevention actions. Traditionally, models for epidemic spreading in metapopulations  rely on reaction-diffusion equations to account for the epidemic and mobility dynamics, and assume that (I) individuals diffuse like random walkers through the network and (II) subpopulations with the same number of connections are treated as statistically equivalent , thus smoothing over the actual contact network between individuals. While this approach has been usefully applied in many scenarios , its simplified assumptions do not capture some important real-world features. For instance, analysis of human mobility data reveals that human dynamics are often dominated by recurrent patterns where individuals have memory of the location they come from  and are highly likely to return to their original location after a short exploration of the network [3,19]. The typical exploration of the network mostly consists in visiting frequently a limited number of locations, predominantly performing commutes between home and work locations . Additionally, the traditional assumption of statistical equivalence of subpopulations of the same degree, while allowing for an analytic solution of the invasion threshold, makes it impossible to quantify the outreach of an epidemic in a particular subpopulation of the network."
PMC6203404,2018-10-16,A novel framework for inferring parameters of transmission from viral sequence data,"Transmission between hosts is a critical part of the viral lifecycle. Recent studies of viral transmission have used genome sequence data to evaluate the number of particles transmitted between hosts, and the role of selection as it operates during the transmission process. However, the interpretation of sequence data describing transmission events is a challenging task. We here present a novel and comprehensive framework for using short-read sequence data to understand viral transmission events, designed for influenza virus, but adaptable to other viral species. Our approach solves multiple shortcomings of previous methods for this purpose; for example, we consider transmission as an event involving whole viruses, rather than sets of independent alleles. We demonstrate how selection during transmission and noisy sequence data may each affect naive inferences of the population bottleneck, accounting for these in our framework so as to achieve a correct inference. We identify circumstances in which selection for increased viral transmission may or may not be identified from data. Applying our method to experimental data in which transmission occurs in the presence of strong selection, we show that our framework grants a more quantitative insight into transmission events than previous approaches, inferring the bottleneck in a manner that accounts for selection, both for within-host virulence, and for inherent viral transmissibility. Our work provides new opportunities for studying transmission processes in influenza, and by extension, in other infectious diseases.","Understanding viral transmission is a key task for viral epidemiology. The extent to which a virus is able to transmit between hosts determines whether it is likely to cause sporadic, local outbreaks, or spread to cause a global pandemic [1, 2]. In a transmission event, the transmission bottleneck, which specifies the number of viral particles founding a new infection, influences the amount of genetic diversity that is retained upon transmission, with important consequences for the evolutionary dynamics of the virus [3, 4]. Recent studies have used genome sequencing approaches to study transmission bottlenecks in influenza populations. In small animal studies, the use of neutral genetic markers has shown that the transmission bottleneck is dependent upon the route of transmission, whether by contact or aerosol transmission [5, 6]. In natural human influenza populations, where modification of the virus is not possible, population genetic methods have been used to analyse bottleneck sizes. Analyses of transmission have employed different approaches, exploiting the observation or non-observation of variant alleles  or using changes in allele frequencies to characterise the bottleneck under a model of genetic drift [8–11]. A recent publication improved this latter model, incorporating the uncertainty imposed upon allele frequencies by the process of within-host growth . Two studies of within-household influenza transmission have provided strikingly different outcomes in the number of viruses involved in transmission, with estimates of 1-2  and 100-200  respectively, albeit that the veracity of the data used to generate the latter result has recently been challenged ."
PMC6206643,2018-10-29,Fomite-mediated transmission as a sufficient pathway: a comparative analysis across three viral pathogens," Fomite mediated transmission can be an important pathway causing significant disease transmission in number of settings such as schools, daycare centers, and long-term care facilities. The importance of these pathways relative to other transmission pathways such as direct person-person or airborne will depend on the characteristics of the particular pathogen and the venue in which transmission occurs. Here we analyze fomite mediated transmission through a comparative analysis across multiple pathogens and venues. METHODS We developed and analyzed a compartmental model that explicitly accounts for fomite transmission by including pathogen transfer between hands and surfaces. We consider two sub-types of fomite-mediated transmission direct fomite (e.g., shedding onto fomites) and hand-fomite (e.g., shedding onto hands and then contacting fomites). We use this model to examine three pathogens with distinct environmental characteristics (influenza, rhinovirus, and norovirus) in four venue types. To parameterize the model for each pathogen we conducted a thorough literature search. RESULTS Based on parameter estimates from the literature the reproductive number ([Formula see text] ) for the fomite route for rhinovirus and norovirus is greater than 1 in nearly all venues considered, suggesting that this route can sustain transmission. For influenza, on the other hand, [Formula see text] for the fomite route is smaller suggesting many conditions in which the pathway may not sustain transmission. Additionally, the direct fomite route is more relevant than the hand-fomite route for influenza and rhinovirus, compared to norovirus. The relative importance of the hand-fomite vs. direct fomite route for norovirus is strongly dependent on the fraction of pathogens initially shed to hands. Sensitivity analysis stresses the need for accurate measurements of environmental inactivation rates, transfer efficiencies, and pathogen shedding. CONCLUSIONS Fomite-mediated transmission is an important pathway for the three pathogens examined. The effectiveness of environmental interventions differs significantly both by pathogen and venue. While fomite-based interventions may be able to lower [Formula see text] for fomites below 1 and interrupt transmission, rhinovirus and norovirus are so infectious ([Formula see text] ) that single environmental interventions are unlikely to interrupt fomite transmission for these pathogens.

Water, food, and fomites can act as environmental reservoirs, enhancing pathogens’ ability to be transmitted from host to host. A thorough understanding of these environmental pathways that affect risk can provide important opportunities for public health interventions. Microbial risk assessment has a long history of focusing on risks associated with food and water transmission pathways. There is growing recognition, however, that many diseases previously considered to be primarily transmitted through direct contact, may in fact have significant fomite-mediated pathways. For example, norovirus, estimated to be responsible for 93% of nonbacterial gastroenteritis outbreaks in the United States , is transmitted not only by food and water, but also via contaminated surfaces. Influenza infection, annually costing greater than $10 billion in direct medical expenses , is transmitted through multiple routes the air, direct droplet-spray (which may be thought of as direct contact), and potentially fomite-mediated transmission. Rhinovirus has also been shown to be transmitted through contaminated surfaces [3, 4]. Guidance on appropriate non-pharmaceutical interventions (e.g., masks, hand hygiene, and surface decontamination) depend on the dominant model of transmission ."

Pandemic influenza A (H1N1) during winter influenza season in the southern hemisphere. Influenza and Other Respiratory Viruses 4, 187–197.  Countries in the southern hemisphere experienced sizable epidemics of pandemic influenza H1N1 in their winter season during May–August, 2009. Methods We make use of the Richards model to fit the publicly available epidemic data (confirmed cases, hospitalizations, and deaths) of six southern hemisphere countries (Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Australia, New Zealand, and South Africa) to draw useful conclusions, in terms of its reproduction numbers and outbreak turning points, regarding the new pH1N1 virus in a typical winter influenza season. Results The estimates for the reproduction numbers of these six countries range from a high of 1·53 (95% CI 1·22, 1·84) for confirmed case data of Brazil to a low of 1·16 (1·09, 1·22) for pH1N1 hospitalizations in Australia. For each country, model fits using confirmed cases, hospitalizations, or deaths data always yield similar estimates for the reproduction number. Moreover, the turning points for these closely related outbreak indicators always follow the correct chronological order, i.e., case–hospitalization–death, whenever two or more of these three indicators are available. Conclusions The results suggest that the winter pH1N1 outbreaks in the southern hemisphere were similar to the earlier spring and later winter outbreaks in North America in its severity and transmissibility, as indicated by the reproduction numbers. Therefore, the current strain has not become more severe or transmissible while circulating around the globe in 2009 as some experts had cautioned. The results will be useful for global preparedness planning of possible tertiary waves of pH1N1 infections in the fall/winter of 2010.","The pandemic influenza H1N1 2009 (pH1N1) was first identified by the Centers for Disease Control in two children in April.
1
 As of 14 February 2010, worldwide more than 212 countries and overseas territories or communities have reported laboratory‐confirmed cases of pandemic influenza H1N1 2009, including at least 15921 deaths.
2 As predicted earlier by many experts (e.g., 3), the southern hemisphere also witnessed a sizable epidemic of pH1N1 in its winter season during May–August, with attack rates exceeding those in a typical influenza season in these countries. Moreover, it is important to monitor changes in antigenicity, severity, transmissibility, and antiviral resistance in the southern hemisphere to compare with those of the spring and winter outbreaks in the northern hemisphere. We construct simple mathematical models using the epidemiologic data for these southern hemisphere countries to draw timely and useful conclusions regarding the role played by the new pH1N1 strain under the setting of a typical winter influenza season."

We conducted a retrospective analysis of 197,207 cases of HFMD over the period 2003–2012 at the national level and of 57,502 cases in 10,080 institutional outbreaks over the period 2011–2016 in Singapore. The effects of school closure due to 1) institutional outbreaks, 2) public holidays, and 3) school vacations were assessed using a Bayesian time series modeling approach. School closure was associated with a reduction in HFMD transmission rate. During public holidays, average numbers of secondary cases having onset the week after dropped by 53% (95% credible interval 44–62%), and during school vacations, the number of secondary cases dropped by 7% (95% credible interval 3–10%). Schools being temporarily closed in response to an institutional outbreak reduced the average number of new cases by 1,204 (95% credible interval 1,140–1,297). Despite the positive effect in reducing transmission, the effect of school closure is relatively small and may not justify the routine use of this measure.","Hand, foot, and mouth disease (HFMD) is a common pediatric disease that is endemic in East and Southeast Asia1,2 and increasingly found in North America3,4 and Europe.5 When caused by Coxsackieviruses, HFMD usually leads to relatively mild infections with symptoms that are self-limiting.6 However, HFMD caused by human enterovirus 71 may lead to complications involving the nervous system and result in reduced cognitive function, delayed neurodevelopment, and motor impairment, or death7–9; in China, an estimated 350–900 children die of HFMD annually.10 Because of this potential severity, the Ministry of Health in Singapore imposes strict control policies, especially in preschools. In preschools, daily routine health checks for all children and isolation of suspected cases are implemented for early detection and control of outbreaks.11 Should transmission continue within an outbreak, school closure is enforced.12 This policy was implemented following an outbreak in 2000 in which several children died from enterovirus 71 complications13,14; the details have evolved over time, but until recently, if a school has more than 16 cases or an attack rate more than 23% with a transmission period more than 24 days, the school will be required to close for a period of 10 days.15 In the most updated guideline, the policy has been relaxed somewhat, and Ministry of Health will consider the predominant circulating strain when assessing closure in addition to the trigger. This change provides an avenue to assess the impact of this policy."
PMC6298769,2018-12-18,Inference and control of the nosocomial transmission of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus,"Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is a continued threat to human health in both community and healthcare settings. In hospitals, control efforts would benefit from accurate estimation of asymptomatic colonization and infection importation rates from the community. However, developing such estimates remains challenging due to limited observation of colonization and complicated transmission dynamics within hospitals and the community. Here, we develop an inference framework that can estimate these key quantities by combining statistical filtering techniques, an agent-based model, and real-world patient-to-patient contact networks, and use this framework to infer nosocomial transmission and infection importation over an outbreak spanning 6 years in 66 Swedish hospitals. In particular, we identify a small number of patients with disproportionately high risk of colonization. In retrospective control experiments, interventions targeted to these individuals yield a substantial improvement over heuristic strategies informed by number of contacts, length of stay and contact tracing.","Antimicrobial resistance is a global concern in healthcare systems due to its substantial morbidity and mortality burden and the lack of effective treatment options (CDC, 2013a; Magill et al., 2014; WHO, 2018). Among antibiotic-resistant agents, Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) emerges as one of the most widespread and virulent pathogens (Grundmann et al., 2006; Klevens et al., 2007; Klein et al., 2007; Jarvis et al., 2012) and has been highlighted as a leading cause of healthcare-associated infections (HAIs) by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) (CDC, 2013b). Initially confined to healthcare facilities, MRSA has since become increasingly prevalent in the broader population in both the United States and Europe (Chambers, 2001; Naimi et al., 2003; Zetola et al., 2005; Hetem et al., 2012; Kouyos et al., 2013; Tosas Auguet et al., 2016). This entwined transmission among hospitals and the community has obscured understanding of the dynamics and persistence of MRSA. Further, MRSA can colonize patients without symptoms for years, during which it can be transmitted stealthily (Cooper et al., 2004a). These epidemiological features have greatly complicated its control and elimination. The prevalence of MRSA has large variations across different countries. In Europe, a general north-south gradient has been observed, with rare incidence in Scandinavian hospitals and much higher occurrence in Mediterranean hospitals (Stefani and Varaldo, 2003; Tiemersma et al., 2004; Johnson, 2011). In particular, Sweden remains one of the few countries with a low prevalence of MRSA infection (Stenhem et al., 2006). A substantial proportion of MRSA cases in Sweden has been imported from abroad due to traveling and healthcare contacts in foreign countries (Stenhem et al., 2010; Larsson et al., 2014). As a consequence, analyzing MRSA outbreaks in Sweden offers a good opportunity to study the hybrid dynamics of MRSA in hospital settings where both nosocomial transmission and importation occurs."
PMC6300203,2018-12-19,"The live poultry trade and the spread of highly pathogenic avian influenza: Regional differences between Europe, West Africa, and Southeast Asia","In the past two decades, avian influenzas have posed an increasing international threat to human and livestock health. In particular, highly pathogenic avian influenza H5N1 has spread across Asia, Africa, and Europe, leading to the deaths of millions of poultry and hundreds of people. The two main means of international spread are through migratory birds and the live poultry trade. We focus on the role played by the live poultry trade in the spread of H5N1 across three regions widely infected by the disease, which also correspond to three major trade blocs the European Union (EU), the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS), and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN). Across all three regions, we found per-capita GDP (a proxy for modernization, general biosecurity, and value-at-risk) to be risk reducing. A more specific biosecurity measure–general surveillance–was also found to be mitigating at the all-regions level. However, there were important inter-regional differences. For the EU and ASEAN, intra-bloc live poultry imports were risk reducing while extra-bloc imports were risk increasing; for ECOWAS the reverse was true. This is likely due to the fact that while the EU and ASEAN have long-standing biosecurity standards and stringent enforcement (pursuant to the World Trade Organization’s Agreement on the Application of Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures), ECOWAS suffered from a lack of uniform standards and lax enforcement.","Highly pathogenic avian influenzas have become a major threat to human and livestock health in the last two decades. The H5N1panzootic (2004 ongoing) has been one the most geographically widespread and costly, resulting in the loss of hundreds of millions of poultry in 68 countries  and over 450 human deaths worldwide—a mortality rate of 60 percent [2, 3]. For H5N1, and other H5 subtypes, most countries reporting poultry outbreaks also report evidence of the disease in wild bird populations, and the mechanisms for the spread of H5N1 have been identified as a combination of wild bird transmission and the live poultry trade [4, 5]. In this paper we reconsider the role of the poultry trade in the spread of H5N1. The background to the study is the somewhat conflicting results of earlier studies. Using phylogenetic relationships between virus isolates at the peak of the first H5N1 panzootic, Kilpatrick et al. identified pathways for 52 introductions in Asia, Europe, and Africa. They concluded that of 21 H5N1 introductions in Asia, 9 were due to the poultry trade and 3 were due to migrating birds; that of 23 introductions in Europe none were due to the poultry trade, and 20 were due to migratory birds; and that of 8 introductions in Africa, 2 were due to the poultry trade and 3 were due to migrating birds . A later study of the same panzootic through 2006 found that except for introductions into northern and southern Vietnam, which were due to the poultry trade, all remaining introductions were best explained by wild bird migration. The authors argued that the spatial and temporal regularity of H5N1 introductions could only be explained by wild bird migration along four flyways the East Asia flyway connecting the Far East of Russia, eastern China and Southeast Asia; the Black Sea-Mediterranean Sea flyway connecting Eastern Europe, the Arabian Peninsula and the Nile River Valley; the East Africa-West Asia flyway connecting western/central Siberia and Central Asia and Africa; and the Central Asia flyway connecting Siberia and northern China to the southern part of North Asia and Southwest Asia ."
PMC6312344,2018-12-17,A graph-based evidence synthesis approach to detecting outbreak clusters: An application to dog rabies,"Early assessment of infectious disease outbreaks is key to implementing timely and effective control measures. In particular, rapidly recognising whether infected individuals stem from a single outbreak sustained by local transmission, or from repeated introductions, is crucial to adopt effective interventions. In this study, we introduce a new framework for combining several data streams, e.g. temporal, spatial and genetic data, to identify clusters of related cases of an infectious disease. Our method explicitly accounts for underreporting, and allows incorporating preexisting information about the disease, such as its serial interval, spatial kernel, and mutation rate. We define, for each data stream, a graph connecting all cases, with edges weighted by the corresponding pairwise distance between cases. Each graph is then pruned by removing distances greater than a given cutoff, defined based on preexisting information on the disease and assumptions on the reporting rate. The pruned graphs corresponding to different data streams are then merged by intersection to combine all data types; connected components define clusters of cases related for all types of data. Estimates of the reproduction number (the average number of secondary cases infected by an infectious individual in a large population), and the rate of importation of the disease into the population, are also derived. We test our approach on simulated data and illustrate it using data on dog rabies in Central African Republic. We show that the outbreak clusters identified using our method are consistent with structures previously identified by more complex, computationally intensive approaches.","Infectious disease outbreaks are a recurring threat to humans and animals, with potentially disastrous impacts on human health, economy, and biodiversity. Over the last decade, major epidemics such as the 2009 influenza pandemic , the emergence of the Middle-East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS, [2,3]) and the West-African Ebola virus disease outbreak (EVD, [4,5]) have re-emphasized the need for assessing outbreaks at an early stage. Indeed, rapid identification of clusters of cases linked by transmission and subsequent intervention remain our best chance of containing, or at least mitigating disease epidemics. The identification of clusters of cases is also key to adapting the response in ongoing epidemics. Indeed, early assessment of the relative contributions of local transmission versus case importation is essential for designing appropriate intervention strategies. For instance, a nosocomial outbreak may be driven by within-hospital transmissions or repeated introductions from the community, calling for different control measures [6,7]. Similarly at a country level, local transmissions and importations of cases from other countries will require different control measures, e.g. social distancing and prevention versus border closing [8,9]. In the case of zoonotic infections, it is also crucial to identify the extent to which within-species transmission and spill-over from the reservoir (i.e. cross-species transmission) contribute to the observed incidence, as illustrated in the case of avian influenza [10,11], bovine tuberculosis , or MERS [3,8,9]."
PMC6312349,2018-12-17,Robustness of the reproductive number estimates in vector-borne disease systems," The required efforts, feasibility and predicted success of an intervention strategy against an infectious disease are partially determined by its basic reproduction number, R. In its simplest form R can be understood as the product of the infectious period, the number of infectious contacts and the per-contact transmission probability, which in the case of vector-transmitted diseases necessarily extend to the vector stages. As vectors do not usually recover from infection, they remain infectious for life, which places high significance on the vector’s life expectancy. Current methods for estimating the R for a vector-borne disease are mostly derived from compartmental modelling frameworks assuming constant vector mortality rates. We hypothesised that some of the assumptions underlying these models can lead to unrealistic high vector life expectancies with important repercussions for R estimates. METHODOLOGY AND PRINCIPAL FINDINGS Here we used a stochastic, individual-based model which allowed us to directly measure the number of secondary infections arising from one index case under different assumptions about vector mortality. Our results confirm that formulas based on age-independent mortality rates can overestimate R by nearly 100% compared to our own estimate derived from first principles. We further provide a correction factor that can be used with a standard R formula and adjusts for the discrepancies due to erroneous vector age distributions. CONCLUSION Vector mortality rates play a crucial role for the success and general epidemiology of vector-transmitted diseases. Many modelling efforts intrinsically assume these to be age-independent, which, as clearly demonstrated here, can lead to severe over-estimation of the disease’s reproduction number. Our results thus re-emphasise the importance of obtaining field-relevant and species-dependent vector mortality rates, which in turn would facilitate more realistic intervention impact predictions.","Over the last few decades there has been a global rise in the emergence and re-emergence of vector-borne infectious diseases . The continuing threat of Plasmodium falciparum malaria [2, 3] and dengue , the rapid, near pandemic spread of Zika virus  or the recent epizootic outbreak of Yersinia pestis (plague) in Madagascar  are just some examples of pathogens transmitted by insect vectors that pose a major threat to global public health. Their dependence on insects for transmission between vertebrate hosts has a number of important implications. First, they are frequently subject to strong spatial and temporal fluctuations due to environmental and climatic variations, such as seasonality in rainfall or temperature. Second, these pathogens should be amenable to vector control. That is, disease transmission can, at least in theory, be interrupted simply by removing the insect vector (e.g. use of insecticides) or by preventing contact between the vector and the host (e.g. use of bednets). Furthermore, it has been suggested that only a fraction of insects need to be removed or vector-host contacts to be prevented for the disease to die out. This concept is largely based on mathematical theory that can be traced back to the first formal description and mathematical treatment of the malaria life-cycle by Ross . Unfortunately, translating theoretical predictions to practical applications, especially with regards to disease elimination through vector control, has only resulted in partial success. The epidemiological reasoning behind the theory relies on a particular threshold condition involving the so-called basic reproduction number, R0, which denotes the expected number of secondary cases arising from a single infection in a totally susceptible population . To date, R0 is frequently used either to predict the extent of an epidemic outbreak or to derive the necessary conditions to prevent this outbreak from happening, e.g. by means of vaccination. The crux of the problem is how to robustly derive or estimate this number in the first place. Compartmentalised systems of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) have been in use for decades to understand infectious diseases at the population level and provide the backbone for most formulas for R0 . These allow the reproduction number to be computed either exclusively using empirically informed parameter estimates or from the initial growth rate of an outbreak . Although the latter is the more common approximation method for directly-transmitted disease [11–14], it has equally been applied to vector-borne pathogens [15–17]."
PMC6361417,2019-02-04,Incorporating media data into a model of infectious disease transmission,"Understanding the effect of media on disease spread can help improve epidemic forecasting and uncover preventive measures to slow the spread of disease. Most previously introduced models have approximated media effect through disease incidence, making media influence dependent on the size of epidemic. We propose an alternative approach, which relies on real data about disease coverage in the news, allowing us to model low incidence/high interest diseases, such as SARS, Ebola or H1N1. We introduce a network-based model, in which disease is transmitted through local interactions between individuals and the probability of transmission is affected by media coverage. We assume that media attention increases self-protection (e.g. hand washing and compliance with social distancing), which, in turn, decreases disease model. We apply the model to the case of H1N1 transmission in Mexico City in 2009 and show how media influence—measured by the time series of the weekly count of news articles published on the outbreak—helps to explain the observed transmission dynamics. We show that incorporating the media attention based on the observed media coverage of the outbreak better estimates the disease dynamics from what would be predicted by using media function that approximate the media impact using the number of cases and rate of spread. Finally, we apply the model to a typical influenza season in Washington, DC and estimate how the transmission pattern would have changed given different levels of media coverage.","Disease transmission takes place in a dynamic social environment, wherein individual health decisions are guided by cultural norms, peer influence, and media influence. Recognizing the importance of individuals’ actions in preventing the spread of infection, researchers are beginning to explore mathematical models that incorporate such actions [1, 2]. These models have been used to inform strategies to control the spread of disease  and to quantify the role of individual protective actions in controlling several outbreaks, including the 2014 Ebola outbreak in West Africa , the 2003 SARS outbreak in Hong Kong  and the 2009 H1N1 outbreak in Central Mexico . A number of models have linked media communication about a disease to protective action [7–11]. These models postulate that media influence increases with the number of infected people [7–9], or with both the number of infected people and the rate of change [10, 11]. Models typically assume that media influence reduces the effective transmission rate, slowing the spread of disease. The susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR) framework used to evaluate the effect of media on disease transmission can be described by the following set of equations
S˙=-f(I,dIdt,p1,…,pk)βSI
I˙=f(I,dIdt,p1,…,pk)βSI-γI
R˙=γI
N=S+I+R
In effect, the population (of size N) is divided into three groups those susceptible to infection (S), those currently infected (I), and those who have recovered from infection (R). The effect of media, f, is an increasing function of the number of infected individuals and/or the rate of change in the number of infected, controlled by a set of parameters, p1…pk. The media function slows the rate of transmission of the disease when the number of cases is high or when the prevalence of disease is increasing rapidly, creating interesting disease spread dynamics, such as multi-wave outbreaks [8, 9]. It is not clear, however, that the media function formalization suggested by the models adequately reflects actual media influence . The choice of media function critically influences the shape of the disease spread , making accurate parameterization of media crucial. Models are just beginning to consider ways to incorporate data on actual media coverage ."
PMC6364646,2019-01-16,Estimation in emerging epidemics: biases and remedies,"When analysing new emerging infectious disease outbreaks, one typically has observational data over a limited period of time and several parameters to estimate, such as growth rate, the basic reproduction number R, the case fatality rate and distributions of serial intervals, generation times, latency and incubation times and times between onset of symptoms, notification, death and recovery/discharge. These parameters form the basis for predicting a future outbreak, planning preventive measures and monitoring the progress of the disease outbreak. We study inference problems during the emerging phase of an outbreak, and point out potential sources of bias, with emphasis on contact tracing backwards in time, replacing generation times by serial intervals, multiple potential infectors and censoring effects amplified by exponential growth. These biases directly affect the estimation of, for example, the generation time distribution and the case fatality rate, but can then propagate to other estimates such as R and growth rate. We propose methods to remove or at least reduce bias using statistical modelling. We illustrate the theory by numerical examples and simulations.","During the last decades, several new disease outbreaks have caused worldwide alarm, e.g. SARS, foot and mouth disease, H1N1 influenza, and, more recently, Ebola. What these outbreaks have in common is the need for estimation of key parameters early on, in order to plan interventions and monitor the progress of the disease. Thus estimation must be performed in the emerging phase of an outbreak, when the number of infected individuals is in the hundreds or at most thousands, while the community fraction of infected is still small. Typically, the early numbers grow exponentially, as also predicted by mathematical epidemic models . There may be many complicating or limiting factors related to incompleteness of data, lack of detailed knowledge about the disease and other issues when analysing data from the early phase of an outbreak. Despite these complicating factors, the conclusions drawn from early analyses, often based on simple models, are usually highly valuable. The aim of the present paper is to identify and highlight some of the potential biases in the statistical analysis of emerging outbreaks and to illustrate how they can propagate to parameter estimates and predictions. A further aim is to give some fairly simple suggestions for how to reduce, or even remove, such biasing effects."
PMC6382747,2019-02-05,Modeling the impact of quarantine during an outbreak of Ebola virus disease,"The quarantine of people suspected of being exposed to an infectious agent is one of the most basic public health measure that has historically been used to combat the spread of communicable diseases in human communities. This study presents a new deterministic model for assessing the population-level impact of the quarantine of individuals suspected of being exposed to disease on the spread of the 2014–2015 outbreaks of Ebola viral disease. It is assumed that quarantine is imperfect (i.e., individuals can acquire infection during quarantine). In the absence of quarantine, the model is shown to exhibit global dynamics with respect to the disease-free and its unique endemic equilibrium when a certain epidemiological threshold (denoted by [Formula see text]) is either less than or greater than unity. Thus, unlike the full model with imperfect quarantine (which is known to exhibit the phenomenon of backward bifurcation), the version of the model with no quarantine does not undergo a backward bifurcation. Using data relevant to the 2014–2015 Ebola transmission dynamics in the three West African countries (Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone), uncertainty analysis of the model show that, although the current level and effectiveness of quarantine can lead to significant reduction in disease burden, they fail to bring the associated quarantine reproduction number ([Formula see text]) to a value less than unity (which is needed to make effective disease control or elimination feasible). This reduction of [Formula see text] is, however, very possible with a modest increase in quarantine rate and effectiveness. It is further shown, via sensitivity analysis, that the parameters related to the effectiveness of quarantine (namely the parameter associated with the reduction in infectiousness of infected quarantined individuals and the contact rate during quarantine) are the main drivers of the disease transmission dynamics. Overall, this study shows that the singular implementation of a quarantine intervention strategy can lead to the effective control or elimination of Ebola viral disease in a community if its coverage and effectiveness levels are high enough.","Ebola virus disease (EVD), which first appeared in 1976 in Zaire (Bowen et al., 1977; Johnson, Webb, Lange, & Murphy, 1977), is one of the most virulent viral diseases of humans, with a case fatality ratio estimated between 25 and 90% (World Health Organization, 2018a). EVD is transmitted between humans through contact with blood, secretions, organs or other bodily fluids of infected or dead humans or animals, and its incubation period range between 2 and 21 days. The symptoms are vomiting, diarrhea, body rash, tremors and in some cases, both internal and external bleeding. The largest Ebola outbreak so far started in Guinea in December 2013 (World Health Organization, 2015). During this epidemic, almost 29,000 people contracted the disease which resulted in more than 11,000 deaths, mostly in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone. A new outbreak started recently (on 4 April 2018) in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and (as of October 20, 2018) there have already been 237 Ebola cases and 153 deaths (World Health Organization, 2018b). Quarantine, defined loosely as the temporary removal (from their immediate abode or the general population) of people suspected of being exposed to a communicable disease, has historically been used as an effective basic public health control measure to prevent the spread of infectious diseases. There are numerous issues pertaining to the logistic of the actual implementation of quarantine as a control strategy, such as who should be quarantined and for how long suspected people should be in quarantine (these have major socio-economic and public health implications). For instance, in the case of the 2014 outbreaks of the EVD, some US states imposed a three-week quarantine period for all health care workers who returned to the United States from the Ebola-affected regions (where they may have cared for patients with Ebola) (Campbell, Adan, & Morgado, 2017; Drazen et al., 2014). It was, however, shown by Haas (Haas, 2014) that the three-week period may not be optimal (in particular, it was shown that exposed individuals with 0.2%–12% risk of developing disease may be released from quarantine prior to the end of the incubation period). On August 1, 2014, the three Western African countries affected by the epidemic (Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone) announced the enforcement of a mass quarantine in vast forest areas around their common borders that are considered the epicentre of the outbreak (a few days later, Liberian authorities imposed a 10-day quarantine over West Point; Sierra Leone announced, on September 6, a nationwide mass quarantine between September 19 and 21) (Eba, 2014)."
PMC6384943,2019-02-22,Estimation of the effective reproduction number of influenza based on weekly reports in Miyazaki Prefecture,"In Japan, as part of surveillance for seasonal influenza, the number of patients per influenza sentinel site is counted on a weekly basis. Currently, reference values are set for the weekly reported number of influenza cases per sentinel, and pre-epidemic and epidemic warnings are issued based on these values. In this study, we examined the association between these reference values and the effective reproduction number (R(t)) using surveillance data for Miyazaki Prefecture collected from 2010 to 2011. There are nine public health centre jurisdictions in this prefecture, and R(t) exceeded 1.0 at the time when pre-epidemic warnings were issued in almost all the jurisdictions. Thus, it was indicated that the validity of the reference value was also high for influenza transmission. However, our results indicated the presence of secondary epidemic caused by infections originating both from other jurisdictions and inner jurisdictions, and it is occasionally not possible to evaluate the end of an epidemic in a jurisdiction using only the reference value of termination. It is necessary to establish new methods after considering the situation in the surrounding jurisdictions for more detailed epidemic predictions.","Seasonal influenza is a respiratory infectious disease caused by the influenza virus, and it occurs annually during winter months. In Japan, influenza is designated as a Category V infectious disease by the Act on the Prevention of Infectious Diseases and Medical Care for Patients with Infectious Diseases (the Infectious Diseases Control Law) executed in 1999. Based on this law, seasonal influenza is listed as a target illness of the National Epidemiological Surveillance of Infectious Diseases (NESID)1, and specific medical facilities such as influenza sentinel sites are expected to report the number of cases to public health centre (PHCs) weekly. Data tallied up in increments of PHC. The number of patients per influenza sentinel site under the jurisdiction of each PHC is publicly available on Public Health Institute websites. Data on the reporting criteria of influenza are also provided. The administrators of influenza sentinel sites are expected to notify cases every Monday if a physician has examined a patient or deceased individual with influenza-specific clinical signs and symptoms, if a patient is suspected to have influenza or if a patient exhibits all symptoms (i.e. sudden onset, high fever, upper respiratory tract inflammation, and general malaise or other systemic symptoms). Notification is also necessary if all four symptoms are not observed, but the presence of a viral antigen is detected by a rapid diagnostic kit using nasal cavity aspirate, nasal cavity swab, and throat swab. Reporting criteria for sentinel hospitals are separately stipulated2. Seasonal influenza is a threat to public health, and issuing of pre-epidemic and epidemic warnings can prevent potential epidemics. A pre-epidemic warning signifies that a massive epidemic can occur within the next four weeks, while an epidemic warning is issued when there are suspicions that a massive epidemic is ongoing or has been persisting. Pre-epidemic and epidemic warnings are basically issued in PHC units, contributing to the early grasp of infection spread and provision of a heads-up to PHC jurisdictions."
PMC6389902,2019-02-25,Quantitative impacts of incubation phase transmission of foot-and-mouth disease virus,"The current investigation applied a Bayesian modeling approach to a unique experimental transmission study to estimate the occurrence of transmission of foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) during the incubation phase amongst group-housed pigs. The primary outcome was that transmission occurred approximately one day prior to development of visible signs of disease (posterior median 21 hours, 95% CI 1.1–45.0). Updated disease state durations were incorporated into a simulation model to examine the importance of addressing preclinical transmission in the face of robust response measures. Simulation of FMD outbreaks in the US pig production sector demonstrated that including a preclinical infectious period of one day would result in a 40% increase in the median number of farms affected (166 additional farms and 664,912 pigs euthanized) compared to the scenario of no preclinical transmission, assuming suboptimal outbreak response. These findings emphasize the importance of considering transmission of FMD during the incubation phase in modeling and response planning.","Preparedness for infectious disease outbreaks can be greatly enhanced by the availability of models that can predict the transmission of pathogens and assess the potential effectiveness of control measures1,2. The reliability of such models depends upon elucidation of key epidemiologic parameters for the disease, as well as a strong understanding of the transmission dynamics in susceptible populations and the effect of intervention strategies on preventing disease spread3. A variety of models have been developed in recent years to identify critical targets for control efforts, predict impacts, and estimate resource requirements for specific outbreak scenarios for foot-and-mouth disease (FMD)4. However, it is critical that mathematical models applied to predict disease spread and impact are built upon parameters that are reliable and representative for the specific host-pathogen combination2. In addition, models used to inform disease control planning efforts need to be able to adequately represent the complexity of the livestock production systems involved and the often inter-linked and overlapping disease control strategies likely to be deployed. Similarly, thorough understanding of the biological relevance of modeled parameters is needed for appropriate interpretation of the modeled output5,6. With increasing emphasis on applying disease control measures in a manner that minimizes the impact and disruption to non-affected industries, models used to inform national strategies for FMD control must often address complex aspects of farm structure, demography, and animal movements, as well as surveillance, quarantine, and depopulation strategies7,8. While the phenomenon of incubation phase transmission of FMD in pigs has been previously identified9, the impact of preclinical transmission and the value of explicitly including this phase in disease spread and control modeling has not been evaluated. The classical definitions of disease state progressions at the level of the infected individual includes the incubation (pre-clinical) and the latent (pre-infectious) periods. Disease control becomes increasingly challenging when the latent period is shorter than the incubation period, since an infected individual may transmit the pathogen to numerous contacts prior to identification of clinical disease and subsequent implementation of control interventions10. The proportion of transmission that occurs during the incubation phase is commonly denoted by theta (θ)11,12. A low value of θ indicates correspondingly low extent of transmission prior to observation of clinical disease. Although a low θ is relatively uncommon, this has been associated with infectious diseases for which control or eradication programs have been highly successful such as smallpox and rinderpest11,13. At the other end of the spectrum are diseases for which θ is remarkably high, such as HIV/AIDS, which are notoriously difficult to control11. Closely related to the concept of θ is the temporal disparity between incubation and latency which represents the period of infectiousness included within the incubation period, defined herein as ω (omega; Fig. 1). While θ is intrinsically linked to the total length of the infectious period (often difficult to measure), ω can be estimated without having knowledge of the termination of infectiousness. Additionally, the basic reproduction number (R0) of a pathogen is frequently cited to project and characterize an infectious disease epidemic. This quantity is defined as the average number of secondary cases generated by a typical primary case during its entire period of infectiousness, in a completely susceptible population and in the absence of control measures14,15. Thus, in addition to aspects intrinsic to the specific host-pathogen combination, R0 will also be affected by numerous extrinsic factors at the population level. Combining estimates for R0, θ, and ω provides a robust background for evaluating the importance of preclinical transmission in successful modeling of disease spread and control interventions."
PMC6402684,2019-03-06,Phylogeographic investigation of 2014 porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) transmission in Taiwan,"The porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) that emerged and spread throughout Taiwan in 2014 triggered significant concern in the country’s swine industry. Acknowledging the absence of a thorough investigation at the geographic level, we used 2014 outbreak sequence information from the Taiwan government’s open access databases plus GenBank records to analyze PEDV dissemination among Taiwanese pig farms. Genetic sequences, locations, and dates of identified PEDV-positive cases were used to assess spatial, temporal, clustering, GIS, and phylogeographic factors affecting PEDV dissemination. Our conclusion is that S gene sequences from 2014 PEDV-positive clinical samples collected in Taiwan were part of the same Genogroup 2 identified in the US in 2013. According to phylogenetic and phylogeographic data, viral strains collected in different areas were generally independent of each other, with certain clusters identified across different communities. Data from GIS and multiple potential infection factors were used to pinpoint cluster dissemination in areas with large numbers of swine farms in southern Taiwan. The data indicate that the 2014 Taiwan PEDV epidemic resulted from the spread of multiple strains, with strong correlations identified with pig farm numbers and sizes (measured as animal concentrations), feed mill numbers, and the number of slaughterhouses in a specifically defined geographic area.","Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) causes acute diarrhea, vomiting, and dehydration, resulting in high mortality rates for suckling piglets . Since 2010, a new PEDV variant belonging to Genogroup 2 has spread throughout the United States and across multiple Asian countries, including China and Taiwan [2, 3]. An initial identification in the US was made in April of 2013 . A 40.5% premises-level incidence of PEDV caused the deaths of more than 8 million newborn piglets in a single year—an event that significantly affected the American swine industry [5–9]. Subsequent Genogroup 2 epidemics have been reported in major swine-producing countries such as Canada, Mexico, Taiwan, Korea and Japan [8, 10–13]. One of the most notable PEDV outbreaks occurred in South Korea in late 2013 , more than a half million pigs died from PEDV infections in Japan between 2013 and 2016 , and a significant increase in PEDV outbreaks occurred in Taiwan around the same time . PEDV is now considered the world’s most catastrophic swine disease, with major financial impacts noted throughout the global pork industry. The PEDV genome is comprised of at least seven open reading frames (ORF1a, ORF1b and ORF2-6) encoding four structural (S), envelope (E), membrane (M), and nucleocapsid (N) proteins . A high degree of genetic diversity has been observed in the S glycoprotein gene [18–20]. Partial spike (S) polyprotein genes located in the virus envelope are central to PEDV biological properties such as interactions with cellular receptors during virus entry, the neutralizing of antibody induction in natural hosts, growth adaptation in vitro, and virulence attenuation in vivo . The PEDV spike (S) protein is a type 1 transmembrane envelope glycoprotein with a 4,158 nucleotide sequence divided into S1 and S2 domains. The S1 region (aa 26–734) is responsible for viral binding, while the S2 domain (aa 735–1383) serves as an anchor for viral membrane and fusion activity [21, 22]. Thus, the S glycoprotein is considered a primary target for PEDV vaccine development. As the major envelope glycoprotein found in virion, S serves as an important viral component for studying genetic relationships among PEDV isolates, and for determining PEDV epidemiological status [23, 24]."

We used reported case counts and time series from prior outbreaks to estimate the total outbreak size and duration with and without vaccine use. We modeled Ebola virus transmission using a stochastic branching process model that included reproduction numbers from past Ebola outbreaks and a particle filtering method to generate a probabilistic projection of the outbreak size and duration conditioned on its reported trajectory to date; modeled using high (62%), low (44%), and zero (0%) estimates of vaccination coverage (after deployment). Additionally, we used the time series for 18 prior Ebola outbreaks from 1976 to 2016 to parameterize the Thiel-Sen regression model predicting the outbreak size from the number of observed cases from April 4 to May 27. We used these techniques on probable and confirmed case counts with and without inclusion of suspected cases. Probabilistic projections were scored against the actual outbreak size of 54 EVD cases, using a log-likelihood score. With the stochastic model, using high, low, and zero estimates of vaccination coverage, the median outbreak sizes for probable and confirmed cases were 82 cases (95% prediction interval [PI] 55, 156), 104 cases (95% PI 58, 271), and 213 cases (95% PI 64, 1450), respectively. With the Thiel-Sen regression model, the median outbreak size was estimated to be 65.0 probable and confirmed cases (95% PI 48.8, 119.7). Among our three mathematical models, the stochastic model with suspected cases and high vaccine coverage predicted total outbreak sizes closest to the true outcome. Relatively simple mathematical models updated in real time may inform outbreak response teams with projections of total outbreak size and duration.","On May 8, 2018, the World Health Organization (WHO) announced the occurrence of an outbreak of Ebola virus disease (EVD) in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). From April 4 through May 7, 21 suspected EVD cases were reported in Iboko and Bikoro, Équateur Province. On May 7, blood samples from five hospitalized patients had been sent to Kinshasa for Ebola-PCR testing, and two were confirmed PCR-positive. On May 21, vaccination of healthcare workers started. By May 27, the ring vaccination campaign was being rolled out as 906 contacts and contacts of contacts were being actively monitored. Six suspected, 13 probable and 35 confirmed EVD cases had been reported, and 25 (52%) of 48 probable and confirmed EVD cases had died. This outbreak had several features that were worrisome for widespread transmission. Cases were reported over a 168-kilometer distance, including four confirmed cases in the ~1,200,000-inhabitant provincial capital of Equateur, Mbandaka, which is situated on the Congo River and bordering Congo-Brazzaville. Moreover, travel to Kinshasa is frequent from Mbandaka. Given these risk factors, early epidemic growth profiles, and evidence of unreported infection from previous outbreaks,[5,6] the risk of a substantially larger outbreak could not be ignored."
PMC6407549,2019-02-20,Diagnostic tests for Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever: a widespread tickborne disease,"Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever (CCHF) is a widespread tickborne disease that circulates in wild and domestic animal hosts, and causes severe and often fatal haemorrhagic fever in infected humans. Due to the lack of treatment options or vaccines, and a high fatality rate, CCHF virus (CCHFV) is considered a high-priority pathogen according to the WHO R&D Blueprint. Several commercial reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR) and serological diagnostic assays for CCHFV are already available, including febrile agent panels to distinguish CCHFV from other viral haemorrhagic fever agents; however, the majority of international laboratories use inhouse assays. As CCHFV has numerous amplifying animal hosts, a cross-sectoral ‘One Health’ approach to outbreak prevention is recommended to enhance notifications and enable early warning for genetic and epidemiological shifts in the human, animal and tick populations. However, a lack of guidance for surveillance in animals, harmonisation of case identification and validated serodiagnostic kits for animal testing hinders efforts to strengthen surveillance systems. Additionally, as RT-PCR tests tend to be lineage-specific for regional circulating strains, there is a need for pan-lineage sensitive diagnostics. Adaptation of existing tests to point-of-care molecular diagnostic platforms that can be implemented in clinic or field-based settings would be of value given the potential for CCHFV outbreaks in remote or low-resource areas. Finally, improved access to clinical specimens for validation of diagnostics would help to accelerate development of new tests. These gaps should be addressed by updated target product profiles for CCHFV diagnostics.","CCHF virus (CCHFV) is an orthonairovirus of the family Nairoviridae causing severe and often fatal haemorrhagic fever in humans. The disease was first described in the Crimea in 1944 and became known as ‘Crimean haemorrhagic fever’, but the virus was first isolated in Congo in 1956 and was named ‘Congo virus’; the two names converged as CCHF in 1969.2 4 5 CCHF is considered an ‘emerging’ disease across the globe, with many countries reporting new infections in recent decades.6–8 CCHF is now found in Europe, the Mediterranean, China and Central Asia, Africa, the Middle East and India (figure 1), and has been reported after long periods of absence.9 10 Cases are typically sporadic and seasonal, and occur in remote or agricultural regions. Ixodid (hard) ticks are a reservoir and a vector for CCHFV, now commonly found in dry or semiarid environments across Africa, Europe, the Middle East and Asia.7 11 12 Numerous wild and domestic animals, including cattle, goats, sheep, camels and hares, serve as amplifying hosts after being bitten by infected ticks, but animal infections are difficult to detect as the tick–animal–tick cycle is asymptomatic.13 CCHFV persists throughout the tick life-cycle, enabling reservoirs of infection over long periods without vertebrate hosts."
PMC6411217,2019-03-11,"Transmission of Respiratory Syncytial Virus Among Children Under 5 Years in Households of Rural Communities, the Philippines"," To develop a more effective vaccination strategy for reducing the impact of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection, especially in young infants (<6 months old), it is necessary to understand the transmission dynamics of RSV. METHODS We conducted a community-based prospective cohort study from 2014 to 2016 in Biliran Province, the Philippines, on children <5 years old. We collected nasopharyngeal swabs from symptomatic children with acute respiratory infection (ARI) during household visits and at health facilities. In households (n = 181) with RSV-positive ARI cases (RSV-ARI), we also identified ARI episodes among other children <5 years old in the same household. In addition, we determined the serial interval to estimate the basic reproduction number (R), the average number of secondary cases generated by a single primary case. RESULTS In the 181 households analyzed, we found 212 RSV-ARI in 152 households with a single case and 29 households with multiple cases, which included 29 1st RSV-ARI and 31 2nd RSV-ARI. We also found possible index cases among children <5 years old in the same household for 29.0% (18 of 62) of young infants with RSV-ARI. The estimated mean serial interval was 3.2 days, and R was estimated to be 0.92–1.33 for RSV-A and 1.04–1.76 for RSV-B, which varied between different times (2014 and 2015) and places. CONCLUSIONS Young infants are likely to acquire RSV infection from older children in the same household. Therefore, vaccination targeting older children might protect infants from RSV infection.","This study was conducted in Biliran Province, a rural territory in the Eastern Visayas region in central-eastern Philippines (Supplementary Figure 1). The territory comprises 1 main island and several small islands and has 8 municipalities. We conducted a community-based prospective cohort study in 2 municipalities, Caibiran and Kawayan, from March 2014 to June 2016. Children <5 years old were identified through household visits and were invited to participate in the study. We enrolled 2348 households with 4012 children as cohort participants. We asked the caregivers of these children to record respiratory symptoms including cough, coryza, difficulty in breathing, wheezing, chest indrawing, and fever every day. Nurses conducted biweekly household visits to check these written records. We collected nasopharyngeal swabs (NPSs) from children who developed fever and either cough or difficulty in breathing within 7 days from household visit onset. In addition, when children with respiratory symptoms such as cough, difficulty in breathing, or coryza visited health facilities, we collected NPSs. The health facilities were the Biliran Provincial Hospital, Naval (capital of Biliran Province), a secondary-level referral and the only hospital in Biliran Province, and rural health units of Caibiran and Kawayan, where qualified doctors provide outpatient care. The specimens were stored in a viral transport medium at 4°C and transported with an ice pack to the Research Institute for Tropical Medicine (RITM) in Manila for laboratory work. This study was approved by the institutional review board of the RITM (2008-05-10, 2013-2) and ethics committee of the Tohoku University School of Medicine, Miyagi, Japan (2012-1-5, 2012-1-63). We extracted viral ribonucleic acid (RNA) using the QIAamp MinElute Virus RNA Spin kit (QIAGEN, Hilden, Germany). Subsequently, the viral RNA was reverse-transcribed to complementary deoxyribonucleic acid using Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase and random primer (Invitorogen, Carlsbad, CA). In addition, real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was performed to screen RSV. Finally, using conventional PCR targeting the G gene, 2 RSV subgroups (RSV-A or RSV-B) were determined for RSV-positive samples, as previously described ."
PMC6425701,2019-03-20,Quantifying heterogeneous contact patterns in Japan: a social contact survey," Social contact surveys can greatly help in quantifying the heterogeneous patterns of infectious disease transmission. The present study aimed to conduct a contact survey in Japan, offering estimates of contact by age and location and validating a social contact matrix using a seroepidemiological dataset of influenza. METHODS An internet-based questionnaire survey was conducted, covering all 47 prefectures in Japan and including a total of 1476 households. The social contact matrix was quantified assuming reciprocity and using the maximum likelihood method. By imposing several parametric assumptions for the next-generation matrix, the empirical seroepidemiological data of influenza A (H1N1) 2009 was analysed and we estimated the basic reproduction number, R. RESULTS In total, the reported number of contacts on weekdays was 10,682 whereas that on weekend days was 8867. Strong age-dependent assortativity was identified. Forty percent of weekday contacts took place at schools or workplaces, but that declined to 14% on weekends. Accounting for the age-dependent heterogeneity with the known social contact matrix, the minimum value of the Akaike information criterion was obtained and R was estimated at 1.45 (95% confidence interval 1.42, 1.49). CONCLUSIONS Survey datasets will be useful for parameterizing the heterogeneous transmission model of various directly transmitted infectious diseases in Japan. Age-dependent assortativity, especially among children, along with numerous contacts in school settings on weekdays implies the potential effectiveness of school closure. ELECTRONIC SUPPLEMENTARY MATERIAL The online version of this article (10.1186/s12976-019-0102-8) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.","The epidemiological dynamics of directly transmitted infectious diseases frequently exhibit highly heterogeneous patterns . In particular, the transmission of acute infectious diseases tends to depend on the age of both primary cases and their contacts , indicating a critical need to account for age-dependent heterogeneity . The basic reproduction number in such a heterogeneously mixing population is derived as the largest eigenvalue of the age-dependent next-generation matrix [1, 4], and its computation with n heterogeneously mixing age groups requires quantification of n × n elements of the matrix. However, it is frequently the case that the degrees of freedom during the statistical estimation are limited (e.g., limited by n different values of input data) . Because use of the so-called WAIFW (who acquires infection from whom) matrix serves as an approximation of the actual heterogeneous contact pattern , this has recently attracted the attention of researchers, and conducting a social contact survey appears to greatly assist in reducing uncertainty with respect to heterogeneous contact patterns and quantifying a WAIFW matrix [6, 7]. In many instances, participants in social contact surveys, who are mostly recruited via convenience sampling, are asked to report the number of contacts they experience on a given day (e.g., a weekday or weekend day) with someone in the same or a different age group, the social setting of that contact, the type of contact (e.g., exchanging a few sentences or physical bodily contact), the duration of contact, and so on. A landmark study reporting the social contact patterns among eight different European countries was conducted as part of the so-called POLYMOD, a European Commission project . Starting with the first study published in 2008, similar surveys have been increasingly conducted across the world, mostly using a written diary [2, 6, 8, 9] or remote sensing device [10–12]. Additional survey methods have also been reported, including the analysis of time-use data  and mobile phone network data . Such empirical data appear to be an essential back-up for infectious disease modelling in the event of emerging infectious disease epidemics, such as the Ebola virus disease epidemic in West Africa in 2014–2016 [15, 16]."
PMC6438571,2019-03-18,Endemicity and prevalence of multipartite viruses under heterogeneous between-host transmission,"Multipartite viruses replicate through a puzzling evolutionary strategy. Their genome is segmented into two or more parts, and encapsidated in separate particles that appear to propagate independently. Completing the replication cycle, however, requires the full genome, so that a systemic infection of a host requires the concurrent presence of several particles. This represents an apparent evolutionary drawback of multipartitism, while its advantages remain unclear. A transition from monopartite to multipartite viral forms has been described in vitro under conditions of high multiplicity of infection, suggesting that cooperation between defective mutants is a plausible evolutionary pathway towards multipartitism. However, it is unknown how the putative advantages that multipartitism might enjoy at the microscopic level affect its epidemiology, or if an explicit advantange is needed to explain its ecological persistence. In order to disentangle which mechanisms might contribute to the rise and fixation of multipartitism, we here investigate the interaction between viral spreading dynamics and host population structure. We set up a compartmental model of the spread of a virus in its different forms and explore its epidemiology using both analytical and numerical techniques. We uncover that the impact of host contact structure on spreading dynamics entails a rich phenomenology of ecological relationships that includes cooperation, competition, and commensality. Furthermore, we find out that multipartitism might rise to fixation even in the absence of explicit microscopic advantages. Multipartitism allows the virus to colonize environments that could not be invaded by the monopartite form, while homogeneous contacts between hosts facilitate its spread. We conjecture that these features might have led to an increase in the diversity and prevalence of multipartite viral forms concomitantly with the expansion of agricultural practices.","Viruses transport their genetic material inside a protein shell, the capsid, surrounded in some species by a lipid membrane. In most viral species, each viral particle contains all the genetic material needed to carry out replication inside a host cell, and generate a progeny of viral particles. A prominent exception to this behavior is found in multipartite viruses. These viruses, first described in the 1960s , have a genome segmented in two or more parts. According to current evidence, the segments are encapsidated separately and, apparently, propagate independently [2, 3]. As of today, there is no mainstream theory able to explain the adaptive advantage of such a strange lifestyle . The main puzzle regarding multipartite viruses is how the simultaneous presence of multiple segments, which imposes severe constraints on the number of viral particles that have to reach a susceptible host, is balanced by other adaptive advantages of multipartitism, whether microscopic or ecological [5, 6]. Despite this apparent paradox, multipartitism is widespread in the Virosphere, as up to 40% of all known viral families are multipartite . A large majority of them infects either plants or fungi, with only four known examples of species infecting exclusively animals . Evolutionary pathways leading to multipartitism are likely to be multiple, since this strategy is present in RNA and DNA viruses, and in the latter case an origin to a single ancestral virus cannot be traced. Beyond its virological interest, multipartitism has a particularly negative effect on agricultural production, as several multipartite viruses are pathogenic, and routinely cripple crop yield . Cultivars themselves may have directly played a role in the rise of multipartitism, as an evolutionary radiation in the diversity of viral species, many being just centuries old, was likely promoted by an intensification of agricultural practices [9–11]. It has been put forward that multipartite species might be at an advantage in the face of environmental changes, since they likely adapt faster due to new combinations of segments promoted by their genomic architecture . It is known that changes in land cover offer multiple opportunities for novel interactions between plants and pathogens [12–15]. Studies on the impact of agriculture in viral ecology have uncovered a surprisingly negative association between plant diversity and family-level diversity of plant-associated viruses, and a higher prevalence of viruses in cultivated areas ."
PMC6542153,2019-05-28,Serological evidence and experimental infection of cynomolgus macaques with pteropine orthoreovirus reveal monkeys as potential hosts for transmission to humans,"Pteropine orthoreoviruses (PRV) are emerging bat-borne viruses with proven zoonotic transmission. We recently demonstrated human exposure to PRV in Singapore, which together with previous reports from Malaysia and Vietnam suggest that human infection of PRV may occur periodically in the region. This raises the question whether bats are the only sources of human infection. In this study, we screened 517 cynomolgus macaques caught in Singapore for evidence of exposure to PRV3M (also known as Melaka virus), which was first isolated from human patients in Melaka, Malaysia. We found that 67 serum samples were PRV3M positive by ELISA and 34 were also positive by virus neutralization assay. To investigate whether monkeys could act as hosts for PRV transmission, we experimentally infected cynomolgus macaques with PRV3M and housed these animals with uninfected monkeys. Although no clinical signs of infection were observed in infected animals, viral RNA was detected in nasal and rectal swabs and all infected macaques seroconverted. Additionally, one of the uninfected animals seroconverted, implying active shedding and transmission of PRV3M. We provide evidence that PRV exposure in the macaque population in Singapore occurs at a relatively high prevalence and this study suggests that cynomolgus macaques may be an intermediate or reservoir host for PRVs.","Pteropine orthoreoviruses (PRVs) are a group of emerging bat-borne viruses, belonging to the genus Orthoreovirus within the family Reoviridae. PRV virions are non-enveloped, fusogenic, and contain double-stranded RNA genomes with ten segments (S1, S2, S3, S4, M1, M2, M3, L1, L2 and L3). PRV1N (alternatively known as Nelson Bay virus) was first isolated in 1968 from a grey-headed flying fox (Pteropus policephalus) in Nelson Bay, Australia . The second PRV isolated was PRV2P (alternatively known as Pulau virus) in 1999 from pooled urine samples from a fruit bat (Pteropus hypomelanus) in Tioman Island, Malaysia . In 2006, PRV3M (alternatively known as Melaka virus) was isolated during the investigation of an outbreak of a severe respiratory and enteric disease among different members of a family in Melaka, Malaysia . PRV infections in humans vary from asymptomatic or mild flu-like to severe respiratory diseases. Conversely, in an experimental infection, nine-week old female Balb/c mice intranasally infected with of 1 × 106 of PRV-MB (PRV10M, alternatively known as Miyazaki-Bali /2007 ) developed clinical signs of disease (piloerection, slowness in movement, anorexia and weight loss) from 2 days post-infection and all mice died by 6 days post-infection ."
PMC6588210,2019-06-21,"Assessing dengue control in Tokyo, 2014"," In summer 2014, an autochthonous outbreak of dengue occurred in Tokyo, Japan, in which Yoyogi Park acted as the focal area of transmission. Recognizing the outbreak, concerted efforts were made to control viral spread, which included mosquito control, public announcement of the outbreak, and a total ban on entering the park. We sought to assess the effectiveness of these control measures. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS We used a mathematical model to describe the transmission dynamics. Using dates of exposure and illness onset, we categorized cases into three groups according to the availability of these datasets. The infection process was parametrically modeled by generation, and convolution of the infection process and the incubation period was fitted to the data. By estimating the effective reproduction number, we determined that the effect of dengue risk communication together with mosquito control from 28 August 2014 was insufficiently large to lower the reproduction number to below 1. However, once Yoyogi Park was closed on 4 September, the value of the effective reproduction number began to fall below 1, and the associated relative reduction in the effective reproduction number was estimated to be 20%–60%. The mean incubation period was an estimated 5.8 days. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE Regardless of the assumed number of generations of cases, the combined effect of mosquito control, risk communication, and park closure appeared to be successful in interrupting the chain of dengue transmission in Tokyo.","Dengue fever is a vector-borne viral disease, caused by dengue virus (DENV) and transmitted by Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus [1–4]. There are four antigenically related serotypes (DENV1 to 4), and first infection with one serotype is often self-limiting , eliciting specific acquired immunity. However, following primary infection with one serotype, infected and recovered individuals remain prone to secondary infection with other serotypes that could induce a clinically severe form of infection, including dengue hemorrhagic fever and dengue shock syndrome [6,7]. DENV infections are seen mostly in tropical and subtropical countries, but nonendemic areas in temperate regions are also at risk [5,8–11], owing partly to the changing ecological dynamics of vector abundance, perhaps induced by global warming  and an increased volume of international travel . Although vaccination is partly underway in endemic countries, concrete plans for the prevention and specific treatment of dengue have yet to be fully established [7,14]. Moreover, the possible drawbacks of vaccination in low-endemicity settings remain a controversial issue . Japan is in a temperate zone and dengue is not endemic in the country. However, Japan has experienced a steady increase in the number of imported cases, mainly from South and Southeast Asian countries [15–17]. Despite only sporadic abundance of Aedes aegypti, the species Aedes albopictus is widespread across Honshu Island and all western parts of Japan, theoretically allowing for chains of dengue transmission to exist [18–23]. Dengue was eliminated in the country by 1945 and transmission has not been observed for 70 years ; however, a German traveler visiting Japan in the summer of 2013 was later diagnosed with DENV2 infection upon returning to Germany . In 2014, autochthonous transmission was confirmed in metropolitan Tokyo [26–31], resulting in a large outbreak involving a total of 160 confirmed cases, a shockingly high incidence for a previously dengue-free nation. It is now recognized that Japan is indeed at risk of dengue outbreaks during the summer season, indicating that a certain risk exists for the summer Olympic Games in 2020. This threat requires concrete planning for possible countermeasures in the event of another outbreak."
PMC6695208,2019-08-05,"Projections of epidemic transmission and estimation of vaccination impact during an ongoing Ebola virus disease outbreak in Northeastern Democratic Republic of Congo, as of Feb. 25, 2019"," As of February 25, 2019, 875 cases of Ebola virus disease (EVD) were reported in North Kivu and Ituri Provinces, Democratic Republic of Congo. Since the beginning of October 2018, the outbreak has largely shifted into regions in which active armed conflict has occurred, and in which EVD cases and their contacts have been difficult for health workers to reach. We used available data on the current outbreak, with case-count time series from prior outbreaks, to project the short-term and long-term course of the outbreak. METHODS For short- and long-term projections, we modeled Ebola virus transmission using a stochastic branching process that assumes gradually quenching transmission rates estimated from past EVD outbreaks, with outbreak trajectories conditioned on agreement with the course of the current outbreak, and with multiple levels of vaccination coverage. We used two regression models to estimate similar projection periods. Short- and long-term projections were estimated using negative binomial autoregression and Theil-Sen regression, respectively. We also used Gott’s rule to estimate a baseline minimum-information projection. We then constructed an ensemble of forecasts to be compared and recorded for future evaluation against final outcomes. From August 20, 2018 to February 25, 2019, short-term model projections were validated against known case counts. RESULTS During validation of short-term projections, from one week to four weeks, we found models consistently scored higher on shorter-term forecasts. Based on case counts as of February 25, the stochastic model projected a median case count of 933 cases by February 18 (95% prediction interval 872–1054) and 955 cases by March 4 (95% prediction interval 874–1105), while the auto-regression model projects median case counts of 889 (95% prediction interval 876–933) and 898 (95% prediction interval 877–983) cases for those dates, respectively. Projected median final counts range from 953 to 1,749. Although the outbreak is already larger than all past Ebola outbreaks other than the 2013–2016 outbreak of over 26,000 cases, our models do not project that it is likely to grow to that scale. The stochastic model estimates that vaccination coverage in this outbreak is lower than reported in its trial setting in Sierra Leone. CONCLUSIONS Our projections are concentrated in a range up to about 300 cases beyond those already reported. While a catastrophic outbreak is not projected, it is not ruled out, and prevention and vigilance are warranted. Prospective validation of our models in real time allowed us to generate more accurate short-term forecasts, and this process may prove useful for future real-time short-term forecasting. We estimate that transmission rates are higher than would be seen under target levels of 62% coverage due to contact tracing and vaccination, and this model estimate may offer a surrogate indicator for the outbreak response challenges.","On August 1, 2018, the World Health Organization (WHO) announced a new outbreak of Ebola virus disease (EVD) in North Kivu Province, Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) . Epidemiological investigations traced EVD cases back to the week of April 30 and identified the initial epicenter to be Mabalako. This region of DRC (Fig 1) has over five million inhabitants, some of whom suffer from armed conflict, humanitarian crisis, and displacement to the bordering countries of Uganda and Rwanda . Since the outbreak began, its magnitude has surpassed all other EVD outbreaks in DRC, becoming the second largest in history to date. As of February 25, 2019, 875 EVD cases had been reported (65 probable and 810 confirmed), and the Ministry of Health of DRC, the World Health Organization, and other organizations were responding to the Ebola outbreak . This is the first EVD outbreak to occur in an armed conflict zone, and this new context has created challenges to the outbreak response . Uptake of traditional control measures such as contact tracing and safe burials has varied with the community, even with the rapid deployment and widespread availability of experimental vaccines and therapeutics . Our understanding of the impact of scientific advances on EVD transmission has been evolving; there has been an underlying, untested assumption that vaccination may reduce epidemic transmission . Mathematical modeling of simulated EVD epidemics suggested that vaccination coverage as low as 40% in the general population and 95% in healthcare workers (HCWs) may avert another epidemic similar to size of the West African one . Studies have yet to estimate the levels of vaccination coverage associated with epidemic decline. An even greater potential problem in difficult-to-access outbreak areas is ascertainment of vaccination coverage among contacts and contacts of contacts. Mathematical models are needed that can produce relatively accurate forecasts in the setting of such unknown but important outbreak response metrics."
PMC6790070,2019-06-04,Social clustering in epidemic spread on coevolving networks,"Even though transitivity is a central structural feature of social networks, its influence on epidemic spread on coevolving networks has remained relatively unexplored. Here we introduce and study an adaptive susceptible-infected-susceptible (SIS) epidemic model wherein the infection and network coevolve with nontrivial probability to close triangles during edge rewiring, leading to substantial reinforcement of network transitivity. This model provides an opportunity to study the role of transitivity in altering the SIS dynamics on a coevolving network. Using numerical simulations and approximate master equations (AMEs), we identify and examine a rich set of dynamical features in the model. In many cases, AMEs including transitivity reinforcement provide accurate predictions of stationary-state disease prevalence and network degree distributions. Furthermore, for some parameter settings, the AMEs accurately trace the temporal evolution of the system. We show that higher transitivity reinforcement in the model leads to lower levels of infective individuals in the population, when closing a triangle is the dominant rewiring mechanism. These methods and results may be useful in developing ideas and modeling strategies for controlling SIS-type epidemics.","In recent years, the study of dynamical processes on complex networks has received significant attention in the mathematical modeling of epidemics [1,2]. There exist three distinct approaches to modeling epidemic spread as a dynamical process on networks. In the first, each node is allowed to change its state with no evolution of the underlying network structure through time, while in the second the network structure coevolves with the state of the nodes [3,4]. A third and more complex approach involves combining the inherent (disease-independent) evolution of social networks with the epidemic dynamics [5–8]. The second approach is more realistic for modeling epidemic spread in cases where the state of being infected influences the presence of contact over which the infection can spread. Pragmatically, the details of the network evolution incorporate potentially several social processes. It is a common observation that healthy individuals avoid contact with individuals suffering from an infectious disease. A recent study shows that humans can identify sick individuals through olfactory-visual cues; furthermore, the human immune system appears to use these cues to motivate healthy individuals to avoid contact with infective individuals , reducing the risk of contagions and increasing the biological fitness. Another mechanism that leads to the severing of ties between healthy and infective individuals is the practice of quarantine, often enforced by public health agencies to stop the spread of communicable diseases. Such a preference in attachment between individuals changes the social network and thus influences the spread of the infection. Studying this interplay between the infection spread and the coevolving network structure has the potential to provide insights into the processes of disease spread. The features of an underlying social network can govern the propagation of an infectious disease [10–14], and there is extensive literature exploring the impact of network structure on the dynamics of epidemic spread on static networks [10–18]. For instance, Ref.  shows that clustering in networks could raise the epidemic threshold and degree correlations can alter the epidemic size. However, results obtained using static network models ignore effects due to the underlying social networks evolving in response to the spread of a disease. Coevolutionary network systems, also called adaptive networks, model the dynamics of node states (e.g., susceptible vs infected) together with rules for rewiring network edges in response to the observed states, providing a more general setting to model disease dynamics. Numerous studies have explored different aspects of the interplay between coevolving networks and epidemic spread [19,20], including extensions to signed networks ; nevertheless, a variety of open problems and challenges still exist despite increased understanding of coevolving systems [22–24]."
PMC6865326,2019-11-18,Factors Associated With Measles Transmission in the United States During the Postelimination Era,"IMPORTANCE Measles cases and outbreaks continue to occur in the United States after the introduction of measles from endemic settings. OBJECTIVE To discern the factors associated with measles transmission in the United States after measles had been eliminated. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This cross-sectional study was conducted from January 1, 2001, to December 31, 2017, in the United States among US residents and international visitors with confirmed measles. A maximum likelihood algorithm that uses the observed dates of rash onset and the known distribution of the serial interval (time between symptom onset in related consecutive cases) was applied to outbreak notification data to estimate the effective reproduction number (R), or the mean number of new infections generated per case. Transmissibility was assessed by comparing R based on the characteristics of primary and secondary cases of measles. EXPOSURES Measles virus. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Effective reproduction number (R), or the mean number of successful transmission events per case of measles (ie, the mean number of persons to whom each patient with measles spreads measles). RESULTS A total of 2218 individuals with confirmed measles cases (1025 female, 1176 male, and 17 sex not reported; median age, 15 years [range, 0-89 years]) reported from 2001 to 2017 were evaluated. Among patients who received no doses of measles vaccine, R was 0.76 (95% CI, 0.71-0.81); among patients who received 1 dose of measles vaccine, R was 0.17 (95% CI, 0.11-0.26); among patients who received 2 doses or more of measles vaccine, R was 0.27 (95% CI, 0.17-0.39); and among patients with unknown vaccination status, R was 0.52 (95% CI, 0.44-0.60). Among patients born before 1957, R was 0.35 (95% CI, 0.20-0.58), and among those born on or after 1957, R was 0.64 (95% CI, 0.61-0.68). R was higher when primary and secondary cases of measles were patients aged 5 to 17 years (0.36 [95% CI, 0.31-0.42]) compared with assortative transmission in other age groups (<1 year, 0.14 [95% CI, 0.10-0.20]; 1-4 years, 0.25 [95% CI, 0.20-0.30]; 18-29 years, 0.19 [95% CI, 0.15-0.24]; 30-49 years, 0.15 [95% CI, 0.11-0.20]; ≥50 years, 0.04 [95% CI, 0.01-0.10]). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE The findings of this study support having high targets for 2-dose measles vaccine coverage, particularly among school-aged children in the United States.","Global coverage with the first dose of a measles vaccine has plateaued at approximately 85% since 2010, increases in measles incidence have been noted in 5 of the 6 World Health Organization Regions since 2016, and at least 1 country in the Americas, Venezuela, has reestablished endemic measles virus transmission.1 The decelerating progress in global elimination efforts implies that measles will remain endemic in many parts of the world and that the virus will continue to test immunity levels in elimination settings for the foreseeable future. Sizeable outbreaks have recently occurred in several US states (eg, New York, Washington, and New Jersey)2 and in other countries (eg, Canada, Vietnam, and the Philippines), pointing to heterogeneity in vaccination coverage. Factors other than lack of vaccination might contribute to measles virus transmission in settings with mature control programs. First, as with other respiratory illnesses, measles transmission is affected by contact patterns, particularly mixing within and between age groups.3 Second, intense contact and high population density (eg, in schools and metropolitan areas) have been associated with an increased risk for measles outbreaks.4,5 Third, studies have shown reduced antibody responses6 and a higher risk for measles7 when the first dose of the measles vaccine is administered at 12 to 14 months of age compared with when the vaccine is given at 15 months of age or older. Fourth, in the absence of boosting from wild-type disease, vaccine-induced antibody titers are known to decline over time,8 and vaccinated persons are potentially susceptible to infection and disease as a result of waning immunity.9 The ability of vaccine nonresponders and of individuals with waning immunity to transmit measles is poorly understood."
PMC6936617,2019-12-04,Modelling and analysing the coexistence of dual dilemmas in the proactive vaccination game and retroactive treatment game in epidemic viral dynamics,"The dynamics of a spreadable disease are largely governed by four factors proactive vaccination, retroactive treatment, individual decisions, and the prescribing behaviour of physicians. Under the imposed vaccination policy and antiviral treatment in society, complex factors (costs and expected effects of the vaccines and treatments, and fear of being infected) trigger an emulous situation in which individuals avoid infection by the pre-emptive or ex post provision. Aside from the established voluntary vaccination game, we propose a treatment game model associated with the resistance evolution of antiviral/antibiotic overuse. Moreover, the imperfectness of vaccinations has inevitably led to anti-vaccine behaviour, necessitating a proactive treatment policy. However, under the excessively heavy implementation of treatments such as antiviral medicine, resistant strains emerge. The model explicitly exhibits a dual social dilemma situation, in which the treatment behaviour changes on a local time scale, and the vaccination uptake later evolves on a global time scale. The impact of resistance evolution and the coexistence of dual dilemmas are investigated by the control reproduction number and the social efficiency deficit, respectively. Our investigation might elucidate the substantial impacts of both vaccination and treatment in the framework of epidemic dynamics, and hence suggest the appropriate use of antiviral treatment.","The appearance of epidemiological dynamics in the mechanism of pre-emptive voluntary vaccination has been studied in various contexts , such as perfect and imperfect vaccination [2,3], dynamical behaviour of vaccination , vaccination with information spreading , metapopulation migration modelling  and heterogeneous networks . Furthermore, Chen & Fu  studied an effective antiviral treatment with prescribing behaviour and resistance evolution. Remarkably, influenza-like illnesses, Oseltamivir (Tamiflu)  is a widely used ex post treatment originally administered against influenza A and B viruses. However, over the years, the societal benefits of antiviral treatment have lessened with overuse, leading to treatment resistance. These trends are evidenced by the interplay between prescription behaviour and resistance evolution. Here, the theoretical studies of vaccination and treatment strategies have considered different effectiveness, associated costs, payoff structures and time scales. Previously, compartment models with the mean-field approximation, such as the SI , SIS , SIR , SEIR  and SEIQR  models, are exhibited by dividing the population into several distinct groups. In these designations, S, I, R, E and Q represent the proportions of susceptible, infected, recovered, exposed and quarantined individuals, respectively. Recently, Kabir et al. extended the simple SIR model by introducing an awareness effect on epidemic spreading and implemented a two-layer SIR-UA model on well-mixed  and heterogeneous networks . Additionally, treatment is an important compartmented state that reduces the disease after infection. Treatments such as antibiotics, quarantine and isolation have been theoretically investigated by many researchers [17–26]. The consequences of vaccination and treatment on an epidemic model were investigated in an influenza model with age structure by Qiu & Feng [27,28] and Feng et al. , an SIVS model with vaccination age by Li et al. , an SIR epidemic model with optimal control theory by Zaman et al.  and a pandemic influenza model by Towers et al. . All these works presumed that vaccination, quarantine or treatment would reduce epidemic infection in a simple dynamical situation on local time scales and with no game aspect. By contrast, the present study aims to establish a theoretical epidemic model encompassing both vaccination and treatment as an evolutionary game approach."
PMC6942315,2020-01-03,Quantifying the relative impact of contact heterogeneity on MRSA transmission in ICUs - a modelling study," An efficient surface cleaning strategy would first target cleaning to surfaces that make large contributions to the risk of infections. METHODS In this study, we used data from the literature about methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and developed an ordinary differential equations based mathematical model to quantify the impact of contact heterogeneity on MRSA transmission in a hypothetical 6-bed intensive care unit (ICU). The susceptible patients are divided into two types, these who are cared by the same nurse as the MRSA infected patient (Type 1) and these who are not (Type 2). RESULTS The results showed that the mean MRSA concentration on three kinds of susceptible patient nearby surfaces was significantly linearly associated with the hand-touch frequency (p < 0.05). The noncompliance of daily cleaning on patient nearby high-touch surfaces (HTSs) had the most impact on MRSA transmission. If the HTSs were not cleaned, the MRSA exposure to Type 1 and 2 susceptible patients would increase 118.4% (standard deviation (SD) 33.0%) and 115.4% (SD 30.5%) respectively. The communal surfaces (CSs) had the least impact, if CSs were not cleaned, the MRSA exposure to Type 1 susceptible patient would only increase 1.7% (SD 1.3). The impact of clinical equipment (CE) differed largely for two types of susceptible patients. If the CE was not cleaned, the exposure to Type 1 patients would only increase 8.4% (SD 3.0%), while for Type 2 patients, it can increase 70.4% (SD 25.4%). CONCLUSIONS This study provided a framework to study the pathogen concentration dynamics on environmental surfaces and quantitatively showed the importance of cleaning patient nearby HTSs on controlling the nosocomial infection transmission via contact route.","Healthcare-associated infections (HAIs) pose a significant health and economic burden globally . HAIs transmission occurs through many processes, including the contact route, in which microorganisms move from surface to surface via contact . An obvious intervention to limit the contact transmission of HAIs is to remove microorganisms from the surfaces and hands, such as through surface cleaning and hand hygiene. And these interventions have been shown to have impact on controlling HAIs [3–5]. An efficient strategy would first target cleaning to surfaces that make large contributions to the risk of HAIs. Studies on the improvement of room hygiene have focused on the high-touch surfaces (HTSs) , near patients surfaces [7, 8], or communal locations , which were associated with microbial contamination of HCW’s hands. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends cleaning and disinfecting HTSs on a more frequent basis than low-touch surfaces (LTSs) in healthcare facilities . However, there are few studies that quantitatively evaluate the relative effectiveness of cleaning and disinfecting different surfaces, including HTSs, near-patient surfaces and communal surfaces, on controlling HAIs via the contact route ."
PMC6962329,2020-01-15,A C-terminal Pfs48/45 malaria transmission-blocking vaccine candidate produced in the baculovirus expression system,"The Plasmodium falciparum gametocyte surface protein, Pfs48/45, is a potential target for malaria transmission-blocking vaccines. However, due to its size and complexity, expression of the full-length protein has been difficult, leading to focus on the C-terminal six cysteine domain (6C) with the use of fusion proteins to facilitate expression and folding. In this study, we utilized the baculovirus system to evaluate the expression of three Pfs48/45 proteins including the full-length protein, the 6C domain fragment and the 6C domain mutant to prevent glycosylation. Expression of the recombinant Pfs48/45 proteins was conducted in super Sf9 cells combined with the use of tunicamycin to prevent N-glycosylation. The proteins were then evaluated as immunogens in mice to demonstrate the induction of functionally active polyclonal antibody responses as measured in the standard membrane feeding assay (SMFA). Only the 6C protein was found to exhibit significant transmission-reducing activity. Further characterization of the biologically active 6C protein demonstrated it was homogeneous in terms of size, charge, conformation, absence of glycosylation, and containing proper disulfide bond pairings. This study presents an alternative expression system, without the need of a fusion protein partner, for the Pfs48/45 6C protein fragment including further evaluation as a potential transmission-blocking vaccine candidate.","Malaria transmission-blocking vaccines (TBVs) are being evaluated for their potential to serve as a supplemental tool to accelerate the elimination of malaria. TBVs function via the induction of antibodies that block the fertilization or the penetration of the mosquito midgut by sexual stage parasite, thereby breaking the cycle of parasite transmission between human and mosquito hosts1–3. Several sexual stage antigens (e.g., Pfs25, Pfs230 and Pfs48/45) have been identified as promising TBV targets for research or early stage clinical development. In clinical testing, Pfs25, when delivered as nanoparticles4, induced functional antibodies. However, the responses were of low magnitude and short-lived5,6. In recent years, development attention has shifted to the TBV candidates Pfs230 and Pfs48/45 in view of the poor outcomes associated with Pfs25-based constructs and the fact that sera from Plasmodium infected individuals are associated with transmission-blocking antibodies attributable to these gametocyte surface antigens7. Moreover, affinity purified anti-Pfs48/45 and anti-Pfs230 antibodies from naturally exposed individuals can prevent the transmission of cultured P. falciparum gametocytes8, when concentrated nine times the physiological concentration, thereby demonstrating the functionality of these natural antibody responses and the potential for these antigens in TBV development. While the preclinical9–11 and clinical (NCT 02942277) development of Pfs230 is in progress, the development of Pfs48/45 as a TBV candidate has remained challenging. The Pfs48/45 protein, expressed on the surface of gametocyte, serves an essential role in the male gamete fertility12 and belongs to the same cysteine-rich structural family as Pfs23013. Consisting of 448 amino acids in its full-length form, the native Pfs48/45 sequence also contains a signal sequence, three cysteine motifs organized as one and half double domains, a putative glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchor and seven potential N-glycosylation sites14."
PMC6962332,2020-01-08,Estimating epidemic exponential growth rate and basic reproduction number,"The initial exponential growth rate of an epidemic is an important measure of the severeness of the epidemic, and is also closely related to the basic reproduction number. Estimating the growth rate from the epidemic curve can be a challenge, because of its decays with time. For fast epidemics, the estimation is subject to over-fitting due to the limited number of data points available, which also limits our choice of models for the epidemic curve. We discuss the estimation of the growth rate using maximum likelihood method and simple models.","Epidemic curves are time series data of the number of cases per unit time. Common choices for the time unit include a day, a week, a month, etc. It is an important indication for the severeness of an epidemic as a function of time. For example, Fig. 1 shows the cumulative number of Ebola cases during the 2014–16 Ebola outbreak in western Africa. The cumulative cases during the initial growth phase form an approximately linear relationship with time in log-linear scale. Thus, in linear scale, the number of deaths increases exponentially with time. The mortality curve (the number of deaths per unit time) shows a similar pattern, as demonstrated by the daily influenza deaths in Philadelphia during the 1918 influenza pandemic shown in Fig. 2. In fact, most epidemics grow approximately exponentially during the initial phase of an epidemic. This can be illustrated by the following examples.Example 1Consider the following Susceptible-Infectious-Recovered (SIR) model(1a)dSdt=−βSI,(1b)dIdt=βSI−γI,(1c)dRdt=γIwhere S is the fraction of susceptible individuals, I is the fraction of infectious individuals, and R is the fraction of recovered individuals; β is the transmission rate per infectious individual, and γ is the recovery rate, i.e., the infectious period is exponentially distributed with a mean 1/γ. Linearize about the disease-free equilibrium (DFE) (1,0,0),dIdt≈(β−γ)I.Thus, if β−γ>0, then I(t) grows exponentially about the DFE. In addition, initially, S≈1, thus, the incidence rate (number of new cases per unit time) C=βSI also increases exponentially."
PMC6987207,2020-01-28,Systemic infection facilitates transmission of Pseudomonas aeruginosa in mice,"Health care-associated infections such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa bacteremia pose a major clinical risk for hospitalized patients. However, these systemic infections are presumed to be a “dead-end” for P. aeruginosa and to have no impact on transmission. Here, we use a mouse infection model to show that P. aeruginosa can spread from the bloodstream to the gallbladder, where it replicates to extremely high numbers. Bacteria in the gallbladder can then seed the intestines and feces, leading to transmission to uninfected cage-mate mice. Our work shows that the gallbladder is crucial for spread of P. aeruginosa from the bloodstream to the feces during bacteremia, a process that promotes transmission in this experimental system. Further research is needed to test to what extent these findings are relevant to infections in patients.","Annually in the United States, 440,000 adults contract a health care-associated infection (HAI) resulting in increased mortality for individual patients and an estimated $10 billion in health care costs1. While progress has been made in minimizing patient-to-patient spread of HAI bacteria, much remains unknown regarding how these pathogens are transmitted between patients. Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PA) is a common cause of HAIs, and in a head-to-head comparison of bloodstream infections (bacteremias), PA was associated with higher mortality than other bacteria2. The reasons for this are poorly understood and this, coupled with the rapid emergence of multidrug-resistant (MDR) and extensively drug-resistant PA, make prevention of PA transmission critical3,4. However, such prevention has been hampered by an incomplete understanding of in-host PA infection dynamics and their relationship to transmission among hospitalized patients. Clinically, PA bloodstream infections are regarded as “dead-ends”, meaning that the bacteria in the blood are neither transmitted to other patients nor spread back to the environment. Once bacteria reach the bloodstream, they are either cleared by the host with the help of antibiotics or die with the host if the infection is fatal. In either case, genetic adaptations in PA that confer an enhanced ability to disseminate to the bloodstream are subsequently eliminated from the gene pool. In this regard, PA is thought to differ from gastrointestinal (GI) pathogens, such as Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi5–7 and Listeria monocytogenes8–10, which have evolved complex lifecycles that include trafficking from the blood to the gallbladder (GB) and subsequently to the intestines, from which they are excreted in feces to facilitate transmission to new hosts. In contrast, PA bloodstream infections would appear to be accidents from which the bacteria gain no benefit. Thus, the fitness pressures responsible for the evolution of virulence factors that facilitate dissemination of PA to the bloodstream are poorly understood."
PMC6998842,2020-02-03,Plasmodium falciparum pre-erythrocytic stage vaccine development,"Worldwide strategies between 2010 and 2017 aimed at controlling malarial parasites (mainly Plasmodium falciparum) led to a reduction of just 18% regarding disease incidence rates. Many biologically-derived anti-malarial vaccine candidates have been developed to date; this has involved using many experimental animals, an immense amount of work and the investment of millions of dollars. This review provides an overview of the current state and the main results of clinical trials for sporozoite-targeting vaccines (i.e. the parasite stage infecting the liver) carried out by research groups in areas having variable malaria transmission rates. However, none has led to promising results regarding the effective control of the disease, thereby making it necessary to complement such efforts at finding/introducing new vaccine candidates by adopting a multi-epitope, multi-stage approach, based on minimal subunits of the main sporozoite proteins involved in the invasion of the liver.","Human malaria is a transmissible disease having high morbi-mortality worldwide; it is caused by five parasite species from the genus Plasmodium Plasmodium falciparum, Plasmodium vivax, Plasmodium ovale, Plasmodium malariae and Plasmodium knowlesi (P. falciparum having the highest mortality rate) [1, 2]. Following the discovery of the parasite’s life-cycle which begins when the sporozoite (Spz) form is transmitted to humans during the bite of a female Anopheles mosquito , efforts at eliminating the disease became aimed at eliminating the vector and its habitats. After the failure of that strategy, the World Health Organization (WHO) efforts were aimed at promoting control programmes, which included long-lasting insecticide-treated mosquito nets and indoor spraying with residual insecticides, anti-malarial drug treatment and early and rapid diagnosis. Government entities in countries having malaria-endemic areas invest around 6.5 billion US dollars annually for controlling the disease worldwide ."
PMC7014667,2020-02-11,The role of hospital environment in transmissions of multidrug-resistant gram-negative organisms,"Infections by multidrug-resistant (MDR) Gram-negative organisms (GN) are associated with a high mortality rate and present an increasing challenge to the healthcare system worldwide. In recent years, increasing evidence supports the association between the healthcare environment and transmission of MDRGN to patients and healthcare workers. To better understand the role of the environment in transmission and acquisition of MDRGN, we conducted a utilitarian review based on literature published from 2014 until 2019.","Hospital plumbing systems are held to stringent standards to reduce transmission of infection to vulnerable patients. However, the aqueous environment presents unique challenges to infection prevention and control (IPC), with wet surfaces providing the solid-liquid interface that predisposes to biofilm formation . These biofilms have been proven to harbour multidrug-resistant Gram-negative organisms (MDRO) [2, 9] which were genetically related to clinical isolates suggesting that aqueous environment can serve as a reservoir for human infections. Furthermore, waste material disposed into the sinks and drains potentially provide the nutrients necessary for the formation and maintenance of biofilms which function as a reservoir for MDRO . These MDRO are not contained within the hospital environment but may spread into the community via the sewage system. Across the world, in Singapore, Bangladesh, India, Lebanon and Spain, raw hospital sewage has been shown to contain Carbapenamase-producing Enterobacteriaceae and other MDRGN [11–17]. As such, it is crucial that environmental contamination and subsequent transmission of MDRGN within the hospital is prevented. Various plumbing components have been implicated in MDRGN outbreaks including sinks and washbasins in separate outbreaks of CRE, MDR P. aeruginosa and polyspecies German imipenemase-1 (GIM-1) [18–21], sink faucet aerators in a CRPA outbreak , and multiple plumbing components from the sink drains to wall pipes in a CRPA outbreak . In a CR Sphingomonas koreensis outbreak, sink aerators, faucets, mixing valves, pipes and other plumbing fixtures were also found to be contaminated . Shower drains have also been implicated with CRPA outbreak ."
PMC7019145,2020-01-10,Large-scale Lassa fever outbreaks in Nigeria: quantifying the association between disease reproduction number and local rainfall,"Lassa fever (LF) is increasingly recognised as an important rodent-borne viral haemorrhagic fever presenting a severe public health threat to sub-Saharan West Africa. In 2017–18, LF caused an unprecedented epidemic in Nigeria and the situation was worsening in 2018–19. This work aims to study the epidemiological features of epidemics in different Nigerian regions and quantify the association between reproduction number (R) and state rainfall. We quantify the infectivity of LF by the reproduction numbers estimated from four different growth models the Richards, three-parameter logistic, Gompertz and Weibull growth models. LF surveillance data are used to fit the growth models and estimate the Rs and epidemic turning points (τ) in different regions at different time periods. Cochran's Q test is further applied to test the spatial heterogeneity of the LF epidemics. A linear random-effect regression model is adopted to quantify the association between R and state rainfall with various lag terms. Our estimated Rs for 2017–18 (1.33 with 95% CI 1.29–1.37) was significantly higher than those for 2016–17 (1.23 with 95% CI (1.22, 1.24)) and 2018–19 (ranged from 1.08 to 1.36). We report spatial heterogeneity in the Rs for epidemics in different Nigerian regions. We find that a one-unit (mm) increase in average monthly rainfall over the past 7 months could cause a 0.62% (95% CI 0.20%–1.05%)) rise in R. There is significant spatial heterogeneity in the LF epidemics in different Nigerian regions. We report clear evidence of rainfall impacts on LF epidemics in Nigeria and quantify the impact.","Lassa fever (LF), caused by Lassa virus (LASV), is increasingly recognised as an important rodent-borne viral haemorrhagic fever presenting a severe public health threat to some of the communities in sub-Saharan West Africa . Discovered in 1969 , LF is endemic to much of rural Nigeria and regions in the Mano River Union . LASV transmits from human to human, as well as via the zoonotic cycle [1, 3, 4]. LF has a high case fatality rate ranging from 1% in the community to over 60% in hospital settings [1, 4, 5]. The common reservoir of LASV is Mastomys natalensis, one of the most widespread rodent species in sub-Saharan Africa [1, 3], which exhibits sensitive population dynamics to the water level, e.g. rainfall, flooded agricultural activities [6, 7]. Previous studies have recognised the ecological association between the population levels of rodents and rainfall [8–10]. LF epidemics typically start in November and last until May of the following year, with the majority of cases occurring in the first quarter of the following year, in addition to sporadic cases reported throughout the year. The 2017–18 epidemic in Nigeria was an unprecedented LF epidemic in the country's history , which resulted in 400 confirmed cases, including 97 deaths, between January and March 2018 . The most recent epidemic in Nigeria has already caused 526 confirmed cases from January to March of 2019, which included 121 deaths . The five states of Edo, Ondo, Ebonyi, Bauchi and Plateau are the only states that have been among the top 10 hit hardest states in terms of number of LF cases in both the 2018 (85.5% of total national cases) and 2019 (85.7% of total national cases) epidemics. While there have been discussions about the association of rainfall level and LF incidence rate [13, 14], this association has not yet been demonstrated and quantified. This work aims to study the epidemiological features of epidemics in different Nigerian regions between January 2016 and March 2019. We estimate LF infectivity in terms of the reproduction number (R) and quantify the association between R and state rainfall. We explore the spatial heterogeneity of the LF epidemics and summarise the overall findings with model-average estimates."
PMC7029531,2020-02-19,"Identification, molecular characterization and expression of aminopeptidase N-1 (APN-1) from Anopheles stephensi in SF9 cell line as a candidate molecule for developing a vaccine that interrupt malaria transmission"," According to the World Health Organization reports, billions of people around the world are at risk for malaria disease and it is important to consider the preventive strategies for protecting the people that are living in high risk areas. One of the main reasons of disease survival is diversity of vectors and parasites in different malaria regions that have their specific features, behaviour and biology. Therefore, specific regional strategies are necessary for successful control of malaria. One of the tools that needs to be developed for elimination and prevention of reintroduction of malaria is a vaccine that interrupt malaria transmission (VIMTs). VIMT is a broad concept that should be adjusted to the biological characteristics of the disease in each region. One type of VIMT is a vector-based vaccine that affects the sexual stage of Plasmodium life cycle. According to recent studies, the aminopeptidase N-1 of Anopheles gambiae (AgAPN-1) is as a potent vector-based VIMT with considerable inhibition activity against the sexual stage of Plasmodium parasite. METHODS Systems for rapid amplification of cDNA ends (3ʹ-RACE) and genome walking methods were used for sequence determination of apn-1 gene from Anopheles stephensi and distinct bioinformatics software were used for structural analysis. AsAPN-1 was expressed in Spodoptera frugiperda (Sf9) insect cell line using the baculovirus expression system. Recombinant AsAPN-1 was purified under the hybrid condition and its biological activity was assayed. RESULTS Asapn-1 gene and its coded protein from An. stephensi were characterized for the first time in this study. Subsequently, the structural features and immunological properties of its coded protein were evaluated by in silico approaches. Enzymatic activity of the recombinant AsAPN-1, which was expressed in Sf9 insect cell line, was equal to 6 unit/μl. CONCLUSIONS Results of this study revealed that AsAPN-1 is very similar to its counterpart in An. gambiae. In silico evaluation and fundamental data which are necessary for its evaluation as a VIMT-based vaccine in the next steps were acquired in this study and those could be useful for research groups that study on malaria vaccine for countries that An. stephensi is the main malaria vector there.","Despite the impressive progresses in medical sciences, according to the World Health Organization (WHO) report in 2018, malaria is still as one of the most significant infectious diseases in the world and there were 219 million new cases with increment of about 3.5 million cases over 2017 [1, 2]. The severity of the disease is directly related to the species of Plasmodium and the geographical dispersion and proportion of Anopheles. There are about 30 species of Anopheles, which are responsible for transmission of malaria across the world . One of the most considerable challenge in malaria control is the diversity of the vector and parasite species in different endemic regions which means distinct strategies must be considered for each geographical region . For instance, Anopheles gambiae is the main malaria vector in sub-Saharan of Africa, while Anopheles stephensi is the most prevalent vector which is spread from the east of Africa (Djibouti and Ethiopia) to the south regions of China . In addition, resistance to insecticides and drugs increases the complexity of malaria treatment and control [6–8]. Moreover, proximity with special endemic malaria regions affects the malaria control progress and, therefore, needs more considerations to achieve the final goal. For example, Iran which is in elimination phase is a neighbour of Afghanistan and Pakistan, which are categorized in the “Control Phase” with high prevalence of malaria. This situation might be established in many parts of the world and may lead to the failure of the malaria elimination goals of the United Nations by 2030 . According to the malEra guidelines, vaccines are one of the main tools for malaria control and with regards to the progress in the elimination programme; specific types of vaccines should be considered for each country. Development of the vaccines that interrupt malaria transmission (VIMTs) was emphasized by the vaccine consultative group for countries that have passed the pre-elimination step and have proceeded to the global goal . VIMTs are divided into various types; one type is the classical transmission-blocking vaccine that blocks the sexual parasite development by targeting the required effector molecules in the vector, including mosquito-based transmission-blocking vaccines with targets such as Anopheles gambiae aminopeptidase N-1 (AgAPN-1) , CPBAg1 (Carboxy Peptidase B1) [12, 13], Trypsin , saglin , FREP 1 [16, 17], and SGS1 . APN-1 is a candidate molecule for which the blocking efficacy against Plasmodium falciparum in An. gambiae has been confirmed . Given the fact that Jacalin prevents ookinete attachment by masking the glycan ligands on the surface of midgut epithelial cells, Dinglasan et al. used affinity chromatography to identify its receptor on the midgut epithelial cells of An. gambiae. Some glycoproteins, such as APN-1, are receptors for the lectin-similar structures of ookinete that trigger the attachment of ookinetes to the internal side of the epithelium and are essential for preceding the sexual development of parasite in the mosquito midgut [13, 16, 20]."
PMC7048795,2020-02-28,Spatial epidemiological patterns suggest mechanisms of land-sea transmission for Sarcocystis neurona in a coastal marine mammal,"Sarcocystis neurona was recognised as an important cause of mortality in southern sea otters (Enhydra lutris nereis) after an outbreak in April 2004 and has since been detected in many marine mammal species in the Northeast Pacific Ocean. Risk of S. neurona exposure in sea otters is associated with consumption of clams and soft-sediment prey and is temporally associated with runoff events. We examined the spatial distribution of S. neurona exposure risk based on serum antibody testing and assessed risk factors for exposure in animals from California, Washington, British Columbia and Alaska. Significant spatial clustering of seropositive animals was observed in California and Washington, compared with British Columbia and Alaska. Adult males were at greatest risk for exposure to S. neurona, and there were strong associations with terrestrial features (wetlands, cropland, high human housing-unit density). In California, habitats containing soft sediment exhibited greater risk than hard substrate or kelp beds. Consuming a diet rich in clams was also associated with increased exposure risk. These findings suggest a transmission pathway analogous to that described for Toxoplasma gondii, with infectious stages traveling in freshwater runoff and being concentrated in particular locations by marine habitat features, ocean physical processes, and invertebrate bioconcentration.","Sarcocystis neurona, most widely known as the main etiologic agent of equine protozoal myeloencephalitis, is one of two pathogens that causes fatal protozoal encephalitis (PE) in sea otters (Enhydra lutris). Following recognition of this disease in sea otters1, S. neurona and Toxoplasma gondii were identified as important causes of mortality of southern sea otters (E. lutris nereis)1. Although exposure to S. neurona may be slightly less common overall2, S. neurona-related disease is generally more severe, at least in acute and subacute cases1,2. A mass-stranding event in 2004 was attributed largely to S. neurona infection forty sick or dead sea otters stranded on beaches near Morro Bay, California, USA within one month of each other, and this parasite was found to be a primary or contributing cause of death in 15 of 16 animals submitted for full necropsies during this event3. Sarcocystis spp. have an obligatory two-host lifecycle. The intermediate host range of S. neurona is broader than most species of this genus and includes both terrestrial and marine mammal species4. The only known definitive (sporocyst-shedding) host of S. neurona in North America is the Virginia opossum (Didelphis virginiana), and sporocysts remain viable in the environment for months. This parasite also infects and forms tissue cysts in a wide variety of endothermic intermediate hosts4. However, because sea otters prey almost exclusively on ectotherms, ingestion of tissue cysts by consumption of warm-blooded intermediate hosts is not likely, and rather ingestion of sporocysts2, either directly or indirectly (consuming a transport host, such as a filter-feeding invertebrate), is the most plausible route of exposure5. Sarcocystis neurona-associated sea otter deaths in California peak in the spring/early summer, and are temporally associated with large rainfall events2,6. Freshwater outflows peak in late winter and early spring in this region, supporting the present theory of land-sea transmission of S. neurona as a pathogen pollutant. This land-sea transmission pathway is also consistent with molecular evidence that terrestrial and marine S. neurona isolates are not genetically distinct7. Though hotspots of high S. neurona seroprevalence have been identified8, it is not known whether specific features of the terrestrial environment enhance infection risk, either due to high loadings of infectious sporocysts onto the landscape or due to enhanced runoff and transfer of sporocysts into the marine food-web. Areas of higher than average S. neurona seroprevalence in sea otters have been identified in areas with abundant soft-sediment substrate such as Estero Bay (see Fig. 1 for study site locations) and southern Monterey Bay8, suggesting a role for bivalves in promoting transmission to sea otters. A dietary preference for clams and other soft sediment prey items has been described as a strong risk factor for S. neurona exposure8. A mechanism to explain this association has not been experimentally demonstrated, but direct ingestion of sporocysts by bivalves during filter-feeding is plausible - bivalves have been experimentally shown to concentrate and retain free-floating Toxoplasma gondii oocysts and Giardia spp. cysts from water9."
PMC7057575,2020-03-04,Animal sources for zoonotic transmission of psittacosis: a systematic review," Human psittacosis, caused by Chlamydia (C.) psittaci, is likely underdiagnosed and underreported, since tests for C. psittaci are often not included in routine microbiological diagnostics. Source tracing traditionally focuses on psittacine pet birds, but recently other animal species have been gaining more attention as possible sources for human psittacosis. This review aims to provide an overview of all suspected animal sources of human psittacosis cases reported in the international literature. In addition, for each animal species the strength of evidence for zoonotic transmission was estimated. METHODS A systematic literature search was conducted using four databases (Pubmed, Embase, Scopus and Proquest). Articles were included when there was mention of at least one human case of psittacosis and a possible animal source. Investigators independently extracted data from the included articles and estimated strength of evidence for zoonotic transmission, based on a self-developed scoring system taking into account number of human cases, epidemiological evidence and laboratory test results in human, animals, and the environment. RESULTS Eighty articles were included, which provided information on 136 different situations of possible zoonotic transmission. The maximum score for zoonotic transmission was highest for turkeys, followed by ducks, owls, and the category ‘other poultry’. Articles reporting about zoonotic transmission from unspecified birds, psittaciformes and columbiformes provided a relatively low strength of evidence. A genotypical match between human and animal samples was reported twenty-eight times, including transmission from chickens, turkeys, guinea fowl, peafowl, pigeons, ducks, geese, songbirds, parrot-like birds and owls. CONCLUSIONS Strong evidence exists for zoonotic transmission from turkeys, chickens and ducks, in addition to the more traditionally reported parrot-like animal sources. Based on our scoring system, the evidence was generally stronger for poultry than for parrot-like birds. Psittaciformes should not be disregarded as an important source of human psittacosis, still clinicians and public health officials should include poultry and birds species other than parrots in medical history and source tracing.","Psittacosis is a zoonosis caused by the bacterium Chlamydia (C.) psittaci. Transmission occurs mainly by inhalation of the agent, which is excreted by birds in feces and in droplets from the respiratory tract [1, 2]. In the 1930s, major outbreaks of psittacosis occurred worldwide, caused by trade of parrots and other tropical birds. These outbreaks are even referred to as ‘the psittacosis pandemic’ [3–5]. In 1985, an outbreak of psittacosis affected employees at a duck processing plant in the United Kingdom . Nowadays psittacosis cases are usually limited to local outbreaks, small clusters or isolated cases [7–17]. Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is the most important presentation of human psittacosis, but microbiological testing for psittacosis in a pneumonia patient is often not incorporated in routine diagnostics. Due to the non-specific symptoms and the fact that often only severely ill patients are being tested for C. psittaci, the disease is likely underdiagnosed and underreported [18–22]. A recent review and meta-analysis of CAP etiological studies estimated that in 1.03% (95% CI 0.79–1.30) of all CAP cases from the included studies combined, C. psittaci was the causative pathogen, with a range between studies from 0 to 6.7% . Based on this result, an estimated 4.4% (95% CI 1.6–8.2%) of symptomatic cases were notified in the Netherlands over the period 2012–2014 . Human psittacosis is mostly linked to parrots or ornamental birds as source of infection, however, recently other bird and animal species have been gaining more attention as potential sources of human psittacosis, such as poultry species, pigeons and even mammals [23–26]. To inform clinicians, public health officials and people at risk of exposure to potentially infected animals, we reviewed animal sources that have been associated with human psittacosis in the recent international literature and provided strength of evidence for zoonotic transmission for each of the animal categories. A literature search of studies describing human cases of psittacosis with an associated animal source was conducted. The databases Pubmed, Embase, Scopus and Proquest (CAB s and BIOSIS Previews) were searched using the following terms and synonyms hereof psittacosis, Chlamydia or Chlamydophila psittaci, psittaci, ornithosis, human, patient and zoonosis. Studies were included from 1 January 2000 to 27 June 2018, because of the major adjustments in taxonomy and nomenclature from the year 1999 . Languages were restricted to Dutch, German, Spanish, French, Portuguese and English. No limitations were applied regarding the study design. The search results from all databases were merged into one EndNote X8 file and removal of duplicates was performed using EndNote and by hand."
PMC7080072,2015-01-14,Epidemiological implications of mobility between a large urban centre and smaller satellite cities,"An SIR infectious disease propagation model is considered that incorporates mobility of individuals between a large urban centre and smaller satellite cities. Because of the difference in population sizes, the urban centre has standard incidence and satellite cities have mass action incidence. It is shown that the general basic reproduction number [Formula see text] acts as a threshold between global asymptotic stability of the disease free equilibrium and disease persistence. The case of Winnipeg (MB, Canada) and some neighbouring satellite communities is then considered numerically to complement the mathematical analysis, highlighting the importance of taking into account not only [Formula see text] but also other measures of disease severity. It is found that the large urban centre governs most of the behaviour of the general system and control of the spread is better achieved by targeting it rather than reducing movement between the units. Also, the capacity of a satellite city to affect the general system depends on its population size and its connectivity to the main urban centre.","With progress in technology, mobility, defined here very generally as consisting of all processes through which individuals change their location, has become more and more prevalent and easy. Among the consequences of this acceleration and generalization of mobility is a great speeding up and easing of the spatio-temporal spread of infectious diseases, as evidenced notably by the 2003 SARS epidemic or the 2009 H1N1 pandemic (Khan et al. 2009). Studying the effect of mobility on the spread of an infectious disease can be accomplished in many ways, illustrating that the term mobility encompasses a wide variety of processes taking place on vastly different timescales. One of these methods are so-called metapopulation models, which consider distinct spatial locations called patches. In each patch, an epidemic model describes the spread of an infectious disease among members of the local population. The locations are then coupled in a graph, with the patches as vertices and arcs representing the possibility for individuals in the various epidemiological states to travel between locations."
PMC7087673,2017-09-29,Economic Incentives in the Socially Optimal Management of Infectious Disease: When [Formula: see text] is Not Enough,"Does society benefit from encouraging or discouraging private infectious disease-risk mitigation? Private individuals routinely mitigate infectious disease risks through the adoption of a range of precautions, from vaccination to changes in their contact with others. Such precautions have epidemiological consequences. Private disease-risk mitigation generally reduces both peak prevalence of symptomatic infection and the number of people who fall ill. At the same time, however, it can prolong an epidemic. A reduction in prevalence is socially beneficial. Prolongation of an epidemic is not. We find that for a large class of infectious diseases, private risk mitigation is socially suboptimal—either too low or too high. The social optimum requires either more or less private mitigation. Since private mitigation effort depends on the cost of mitigation and the cost of illness, interventions that change either of these costs may be used to alter mitigation decisions. We model the potential for instruments that affect the cost of illness to yield net social benefits. We find that where a disease is not very infectious or the duration of illness is short, it may be socially optimal to promote private mitigation effort by increasing the cost of illness. By contrast, where a disease is highly infectious or long lasting, it may be optimal to discourage private mitigation by reducing the cost of disease. Society would prefer a shorter, more intense, epidemic to a longer, less intense epidemic. There is, however, a region in parameter space where the relationship is more complicated. For moderately infectious diseases with medium infectious periods, the social optimum depends on interactions between prevalence and duration. Basic reproduction numbers are not sufficient to predict the social optimum.","During an epidemic, there are several options available to private individuals interested in managing infectious disease risk. These include self-quarantine, vaccination, voluntary travel restrictions, contact reduction, prophylaxis, and preferential mixing (Philipson 1996; Geoffard and Philipson 1997; Philipson 2000; Taylor and Ampt 2003; Brownstein et al. 2006; Ferguson et al. 2006; Germann et al. 2006; Hunter 2007; Rao et al. 2009; Curtis et al. 2011; Fenichel et al. 2013). The choice of which measures to use frequently depends on costs—the cost of illness and the cost of risk mitigation. The cost of illness is determined by the likelihood that people will become infected if they make contact with an infectious individual, together with the cost of treatment and loss of earnings if they do become infected. The cost of risk mitigation is the resources sacrificed to reduce risk by some amount. Diseases that are perceived to be highly infectious and life-threatening warrant greater private risk mitigation effort than diseases that are perceived to be only moderately infectious and with few symptoms (Sanchez 2001; Leroy et al. 2005; Team 2014). Diseases that are novel, and therefore uncertain in their effects, warrant greater private risk mitigation effort than diseases that are more familiar (Taylor et al. 2001; Presanis et al. 2009; Rubin et al. 2009). It follows that private risk mitigation efforts might be expected to evolve over the course of an epidemic as information improves. A number of studies have, for example, tracked changes in the efforts made by private individuals to reduce disease risk during the 2009 A/H1N1 epidemic (Fenichel et al. 2013; Bayham et al. 2015; Springborn et al. 2015). The problem addressed in this paper is that disease risk mitigation by one individual affects the well-being of both that individual and others. People vaccinating themselves against seasonal influenza, for example, reduce the likelihood that they will become infected, but also reduce the likelihood that they will become infectious. Vaccination, in such cases, is said to be an impure public good. It confers benefits on the individual, but also on those with whom the individual interacts (Sandler et al. 2002). On the other hand, people avoiding infection now by sequestering themselves may simply delay the moment at which they become infected and infectious and hence may unwittingly prolong an epidemic (Fenichel et al. 2011). Private disease-risk mitigation, in this case, is an impure public bad. In providing benefits to the individual, it imposes costs on society. Because people cannot capture any wider benefits they confer, and are not confronted by any wider costs they impose, they have little incentive to take those benefits and costs into account when making their decisions. The public good (bad) is therefore under-provided (over-provided)."
PMC7087808,2019-11-26,Mx genes: host determinants controlling influenza virus infection and trans-species transmission,"The human MxA protein, encoded by the interferon-inducible MX1 gene, is an intracellular influenza A virus (IAV) restriction factor. It can protect transgenic mice from severe IAV-induced disease, indicating a key role of human MxA for host survival and suggesting that natural variations in MX1 may account for inter-individual differences in disease severity among humans. MxA also provides a robust barrier against zoonotic transmissions of avian and swine IAV strains. Therefore, zoonotic IAV must acquire MxA escape mutations to achieve sustained human-to-human transmission. Here, we discuss recent progress in the field.","Infections with seasonal influenza A viruses (IAV) are usually self-limiting, but in rare cases may become life-threatening or even fatal. The striking inter-individual variability in disease outcome is best explained by pre-existing immunity, co-morbidity, or age. In previously healthy non-vaccinated children and young adults, however, the cause for fatal influenza pneumonia is less obvious. Recent studies revealed that alterations in genes controlling innate immunity are involved in such cases (Casanova and Abel 2018; Ciancanelli et al. 2016; Zhang et al. 2019). Interestingly, genetic susceptibility to devastating influenza does not appear to be a polygenic trait, but is determined by defects in single genes that govern non-redundant pathways of type I (α/β) and type III (λ) interferon (IFN) responses. Critical genes identified so far are either involved in induction of type I and type III IFNs (TLR3, IRF7) (Ciancanelli et al. 2015; Lim et al. 2019), IFN production by plasmacytoid dendritic cells (GATA2) (Sologuren et al. 2018) or are part of the IFN signaling pathway required for antiviral action (IRF9) (Hernandez et al. 2018). Surprisingly, however, no clear defects have yet been found in type I and type III IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs). The only alterations in a gene associated with severe seasonal influenza in hospitalized patients were two single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) in IFITM3. One, rs12252, leads to a truncation (Everitt et al. 2012; Xuan et al. 2015; Zhang et al. 2013), and the other, rs34481144i, to diminished expression and impaired recruitment of immune CD8+ T cells into the infected airways (Allen et al. 2017). Still, the role of IFITM3 in human influenza infections remains controversial (Mills et al. 2014; Williams et al. 2014; Zani and Yount 2018). Much experimental evidence indicates that the human MX1 gene may also play a critical role in the outcome of human IAV infections. MX1 is located on the long arm of chromosome 21 (map position 21q22.3) and contains 17 exons extending over 33 kb (Horisberger et al. 1988; Tazi-Ahnini et al. 2000). It encodes a large GTPase, MxA, which mediates broad resistance to influenza and other viruses both in cell culture (Aebi et al. 1989; Haller et al. 2015) and transgenic mice (Deeg et al. 2017; Hefti et al. 1999; Pavlovic et al. 1995). Interestingly, there are humans harboring allelic variants in MX1 (Duc et al. 2012; Graf et al. 2018; Tazi-Ahnini et al. 2000) in heterozygous or homozygous form, but none of these variants have so far been linked to enhanced influenza virus susceptibility (Ciancanelli et al. 2016; Graf et al. 2018). Nevertheless, as outlined in this review, MX1 remains a strong candidate gene for controlling influenza virus susceptibility in humans."
PMC7088255,2010-03-25,"Community-acquired methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus: community transmission, pathogenesis, and drug resistance","Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is able to persist not only in hospitals (with a high level of antimicrobial agent use) but also in the community (with a low level of antimicrobial agent use). The former is called hospital-acquired MRSA (HA-MRSA) and the latter community-acquired MRSA (CA-MRSA). It is believed MRSA clones are generated from S. aureus through insertion of the staphylococcal cassette chromosome mec (SCCmec), and outbreaks occur as they spread. Several worldwide and regional clones have been identified, and their epidemiological, clinical, and genetic characteristics have been described. CA-MRSA is likely able to survive in the community because of suitable SCCmec types (type IV or V), a clone-specific colonization/infection nature, toxin profiles (including Pantone-Valentine leucocidin, PVL), and narrow drug resistance patterns. CA-MRSA infections are generally seen in healthy children or young athletes, with unexpected cases of diseases, and also in elderly inpatients, occasionally surprising clinicians used to HA-MRSA infections. CA-MRSA spreads within families and close-contact groups or even through public transport, demonstrating transmission cores. Re-infection (including multifocal infection) frequently occurs, if the cores are not sought out and properly eradicated. Recently, attention has been given to CA-MRSA (USA300), which originated in the US, and is growing as HA-MRSA and also as a worldwide clone. CA-MRSA infection in influenza season has increasingly been noted as well. MRSA is also found in farm and companion animals, and has occasionally transferred to humans. As such, the epidemiological, clinical, and genetic behavior of CA-MRSA, a growing threat, is focused on in this study.","Staphylococcus aureus colonizes the nasal mucosa of approximately 30% of individuals. It is associated with a wide range of infections including skin and soft tissue infections (SSTIs, such as bullous impetigo, abscesses, furunculosis, and staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome), systemic or fatal infections [such as blood stream infection (BSI), endocarditis, and pneumonia], and toxin-associated diseases (such as toxic shock syndrome and food poisoning) [1–4]. Historically, several classes of drug-resistant S. aureus have emerged [5–7]. They include penicillin G-resistant S. aureus, which produced penicillinase (PCase, penicillin-hydrolyzing enzyme) in the mid 1940s, and multidrug-resistant S. aureus (which was resistant to penicillin G, chloramphenicol, tetracycline, and erythromycin) in the late 1950s. Methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA), isolated in 1961, continues to be a life-threatening multidrug-resistant bacterium, changing its resistance patterns by acquiring resistance to each new antimicrobial agent. Such MRSA has been a major cause of nosocomial infections, and thus is alternatively called hospital-acquired MRSA (HA-MRSA). In addition, since the period from 1997 to 1999, another class of MRSA has become a major concern worldwide as an emerging pathogen in the community [8–11]. This new class of MRSA is called community-acquired MRSA (CA-MRSA). Ideally, MRSA in the community should impose no biological cost, i.e., it carries a certain type of staphylococcal cassette chromosome mec (SCCmec) and exhibits resistance to only limited numbers of antimicrobial agents. In turn, it can be selected by low levels of antimicrobial agent use in the community [12–14]. By contrast, MRSA in hospitals carries some other SCCmec types or exhibits multiple drug resistance, i.e., it imposes a high biological cost. Therefore, it has to be selected by high levels of antimicrobial agent use in hospitals to overcome the biological cost (in turn, transfer to the community is restricted) [12, 15, 16]. Moreover, CA-MRSA must have high colonization and infection abilities to distribute among healthy individuals in the community."
PMC7088300,2010-08-17,A random walk model for infection on graphs: spread of epidemics & rumours with mobile agents,"We address the question of understanding the effect of the underlying network topology on the spread of a virus and the dissemination of information when users are mobile performing independent random walks on a graph. To this end, we propose a simple model of infection that enables to study the coincidence time of two random walkers on an arbitrary graph. By studying the coincidence time of a susceptible and an infected individual both moving in the graph we obtain estimates of the infection probability. The main result of this paper is to pinpoint the impact of the network topology on the infection probability. More precisely, we prove that for homogeneous graphs including regular graphs and the classical Erdős–Rényi model, the coincidence time is inversely proportional to the number of nodes in the graph. We then study the model on power-law graphs, that exhibit heterogeneous connectivity patterns, and show the existence of a phase transition for the coincidence time depending on the parameter of the power-law of the degree distribution. We finally undertake a preliminary analysis for the case with k random walkers and provide upper bounds on the convergence time for both the complete graph and regular graphs.","In what follows, we briefly describe some of the relevant related work on modelling epidemic spreading in mobile environments. To our knowledge, the first attempts to model virus spreading in mobile networks rely on the use of non-rigorous mean-field approximations (similar to the classical Kephart–White model Kephart and White 1991) that incorporate the mobility patterns of users. In Mickens and Noble , the authors derive a threshold for the persistence of the epidemic by computing the average number of neighbours of a given node. Using a similar approach but with different mobility patterns, Nekovee , Rhodes and Nekovee  explore the evolution of the number of devices that are infected in terms of the contact rate between users. A related line of work studying the dissemination of information in opportunistic networks (Chaintreau et al. 2007) focuses on the following analogous problem Suppose that a set of mobile agents with wireless communication capabilities, forming a temporary network without the aid of a fixed infrastructure, are interested in a piece of information that is initially held by one user. The information is transmitted between users who happen to be in each other’s range. As in the case of static networks (Pittel 1987), one may be interested in the time it takes for the rumour to be known to all users. To this end we need to understand how information is transmitted between an informed and an ignorant user. This is also relevant to patterns of opinion formation and propagation of trends on social networks (Amini et al. 2009). Our work gives some insight on the impact of the network structure on the likelihood of successfully transmitting the rumour."
PMC7088875,2015-05-15,An Epidemic Patchy Model with Entry–Exit Screening,"A multi-patch SEIQR epidemic model is formulated to investigate the long-term impact of entry–exit screening measures on the spread and control of infectious diseases. A threshold dynamics determined by the basic reproduction number [Formula see text] is established The disease can be eradicated if [Formula see text] , while the disease persists if [Formula see text] . As an application, six different screening strategies are explored to examine the impacts of screening on the control of the 2009 influenza A (H1N1) pandemic. We find that it is crucial to screen travelers from and to high-risk patches, and it is not necessary to implement screening in all connected patches, and both the dispersal rates and the successful detection rate of screening play an important role on determining an effective and practical screening strategy.","With the rapidly growing travel among cities and countries, newly emerging infectious diseases and many re-emerging once-controlled infectious diseases have the trend to spread regionally and globally much faster than ever before (Jones et al. 2008). International travel has been a major factor causing the SARS outbreak in 2003 (Lipsitch et al. 2003; Ruan et al. 2006), the A (H1N1) influenza pandemic in 2009 (Tang et al. 2010, 2012; Yu et al. 2012), and the outbreak of a novel avian-origin influenza A(H7N9) (Gao et al. 2013). To better understand how travel among patches (a patch could be as small as a community village, or as large as a country or even a continent) influences the spread of infectious diseases, many deterministic models involving the interaction and dispersal of meta-populations in two or multiple patches have been proposed and investigated. See for example, Allen et al. , Alonso and McKane , Arino et al. , Arino and van den Driessche (2003a, (2003b, , Bolker , Brauer and van den Driessche , Brauer et al. , Brown and Bolker , Eisenberg et al. , Gao and Ruan , Hethcote , Hsieh et al. , Sattenspiel and Herring  and references therein. Being aware that travel can quickly bring infectious diseases from one patch to another, it is natural for the authorities to implement traveler health screening measures at borders for exit and entry when an outbreak occurs. For example, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the influenza A (H1N1) outbreak a pandemic in June of 2009. As a response, many countries implemented the entry–exit health screening measures for travelers (Ainseba and Iannelli 2012; Cowling et al. 2010). In China, a national surveillance was established which includes the border entry screening Any one entering China was required to undergo screening at the border. Moreover, all patients with suspected A (H1N1) pdm09 virus infection were admitted to designated hospitals for containment (Yu et al. 2010). Exit screening was also conducted by the screening of travelers at Mexican airports before they boarded flights out of Mexico (Khan et al. 2013). There are several broad approaches to border screening, including scan of travelers by thermal scanners for elevated body temperature, observation of travelers by alert staff for influenza symptoms (e.g., cough) as well as collection of health declaration forms (Cowling et al. 2010; Li et al. 2013). During the 2009 A (H1N1) pandemic, it was shown that about one-third of confirmed imported H1N1 cases were identified through entry screening to Hong Kong and Singapore (Cowling et al. 2010), while for China, the detection rate of entry screening was about 45.56 % (1027 detected cases over the total 2254 imported cases) (Li et al. 2013)."
PMC7088888,2018-06-11,Transmission Dynamics of an SIS Model with Age Structure on Heterogeneous Networks,"Infection age is often an important factor in epidemic dynamics. In order to realistically analyze the spreading mechanism and dynamical behavior of epidemic diseases, in this paper, a generalized disease transmission model of SIS type with age-dependent infection and birth and death on a heterogeneous network is discussed. The model allows the infection and recovery rates to vary and depend on the age of infection, the time since an individual becomes infected. We address uniform persistence and find that the model has the sharp threshold property, that is, for the basic reproduction number less than one, the disease-free equilibrium is globally asymptotically stable, while for the basic reproduction number is above one, a Lyapunov functional is used to show that the endemic equilibrium is globally stable. Finally, some numerical simulations are carried out to illustrate and complement the main results. The disease dynamics rely not only on the network structure, but also on an age-dependent factor (for some key functions concerned in the model).","Infectious diseases remain a major challenge for human society. Epidemic diseases (cholera, tuberculosis, SARS, influenza, Ebola virus, etc.) continue to have both a major impact on humans and an economic cost to society. Any gain in understanding the dynamics and control of epidemic transmission therefore has potential for significant impact—and hence has been the focus of scientific research and attracted much attention (Anderson and May 1991; Bailey 1975; Kermack and McKendrick 1927, 1932). Epidemic dynamic models provide a theoretical method for quantitative studies of infectious diseases. Since Kermack and McKendrick proposed SIR and SIS compartmental models to study disease transmission (Kermack and McKendrick 1927, 1932), epidemic models for the transmission of infectious diseases have been extensively studied. These classical compartmental models are important tools in analyzing the spread and control of infectious diseases, but usually neglect the population structure or assume that all individuals have the same possibility to contact others—they are most effective for well-mixed homogeneous populations with a substantial penetration of infection. However, the spreading of infectious diseases is primarily via specific contacts between individuals, emerging diseases start with a relative small number of infectious, and the possibility to contact others is heterogeneous. Therefore, depicting the spread of disease processes on a contact network can be more realistic (Levin and Durrett 1996; Read and Keeling 2003; Keeling and Eames 2005; Durrett and Jung 2007). Currently, the most popular transmission models on networks are based on mean-field approximations and follow the framework initially proposed by Pastor-Satorras and Vespignani (2001a, b, 2002). These were the first to study SIS epidemic model on a scale-free network and show that the epidemic threshold is infinitesimal in the limit of a large number of links and nodes. Since then, a great deal of epidemiological research work followed on scale-free (and other) networks (House et al. 2009; Olinky and Stone 2004; Fu et al. 2008; Colizzaa et al. 2006; Wang and Dai 2008)."
PMC7091180,2013-12-30,A model of bi-mode transmission dynamics of hepatitis C with optimal control,"In this paper, we present a rigorous mathematical analysis of a deterministic model for the transmission dynamics of hepatitis C. The model is suitable for populations where two frequent modes of transmission of hepatitis C virus, namely unsafe blood transfusions and intravenous drug use, are dominant. The susceptible population is divided into two distinct compartments, the intravenous drug users and individuals undergoing unsafe blood transfusions. Individuals belonging to each compartment may develop acute and then possibly chronic infections. Chronically infected individuals may be quarantined. The analysis indicates that the eradication and persistence of the disease is completely determined by the magnitude of basic reproduction number R (c). It is shown that for the basic reproduction number R (c) < 1, the disease-free equilibrium is locally and globally asymptotically stable. For R (c) > 1, an endemic equilibrium exists and the disease is uniformly persistent. In addition, we present the uncertainty and sensitivity analyses to investigate the influence of different important model parameters on the disease prevalence. When the infected population persists, we have designed a time-dependent optimal quarantine strategy to minimize it. The Pontryagin’s Maximum Principle is used to characterize the optimal control in terms of an optimality system which is solved numerically. Numerical results for the optimal control are compared against the constant controls and their efficiency is discussed.","Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is the common cause of liver diseases worldwide and a major public health problem (Bisceglie 1998). The disease hepatitis C was first recognized in 1975 and the causative agent HCV was identified in 1989. Hepatitis C is characterized by an acute, often asymptomatic stage, followed in most cases by chronic infection that can lead to cirrhosis and liver cancer. HCV, which causes hepatitis C in humans, is a small, enveloped, positive-sense single-stranded RNA virus of the family Flaviviridae. Replication of the RNA-based virus involves the use of the enzyme RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP) that has a high error rate. Consequently, the virus mutates very rapidly and has no single genotype. Currently, there are seven known genotypes of HCV (Jawaid and Khuwaja 2008; Torresi et al. 2011). According to World Health Organization, nearly 3 % of the world population has been infected with HCV. An estimated 170 million people globally are infected with chronic HCV and are at risk of developing liver cancer/cirrhosis, while nearly 350,000 people die worldwide as a result of hepatitis C-related liver diseases each year (Waheed et al. 2009; Jiwani and Gul 2011). Hepatitis C is characterized by an acute and a chronic stage. Initial infection by HCV results in acute hepatitis C, which is largely asymptomatic. Only about 15 % of cases display mild symptoms such as decreased appetite, fatigue, nausea, muscle or joint pains, and weight loss. The infection resolves spontaneously in 20% of the cases. About 80% of the people exposed to HCV, however, eventually develop a chronic infection, thus progressing to the chronic stage of the disease. This stage can last for decades. Most people experience minimal or no symptoms during the initial few years of the infection. After several years of living with the disease hepatitis C becomes the primary cause of cirrhosis and liver cancer. Nearly 5–20 % of chronic hepatitis C patients develop cirrhosis over 30 years and 1–5 % die from cirrhosis or liver cancer. Those who develop cirrhosis have a 20-fold greater risk of hepatocellular carcinoma, a rate of 13 % per year. It is estimated that hepatitis C is the cause of 27 % of cirrhosis cases and 25 % of hepatocellular carcinoma worldwide (Bisceglie et al. 1991; Fattovich 1997; Kiyosawa 1990; Hutin 2004)."
PMC7094885,2013-07-10,Pathogenesis and transmission of avian influenza A (H7N9) virus in ferrets and mice,"On 29 March 2013, the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention confirmed the first reported case of human infection with an avian influenza A(H7N9) virus. The recent human infections with H7N9 virus, totalling over 130 cases with 39 fatalities to date, have been characterized by severe pulmonary disease and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). This is concerning because H7 viruses have typically been associated with ocular disease in humans, rather than severe respiratory disease. This recent outbreak underscores the need to better understand the pathogenesis and transmission of these viruses in mammals. Here we assess the ability of A/Anhui/1/2013 and A/Shanghai/1/2013 (H7N9) viruses, isolated from fatal human cases, to cause disease in mice and ferrets and to transmit to naive animals. Both H7N9 viruses replicated to higher titre in human airway epithelial cells and in the respiratory tract of ferrets compared to a seasonal H3N2 virus. Moreover, the H7N9 viruses showed greater infectivity and lethality in mice compared to genetically related H7N9 and H9N2 viruses. The H7N9 viruses were readily transmitted to naive ferrets through direct contact but, unlike the seasonal H3N2 virus, did not transmit readily by respiratory droplets. The lack of efficient respiratory droplet transmission was corroborated by low receptor-binding specificity for human-like α2,6-linked sialosides. Our results indicate that H7N9 viruses have the capacity for efficient replication in mammals and human airway cells and highlight the need for continued public health surveillance of this emerging virus. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION The online version of this article (doi10.1038/nature12391) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.","Laboratory-confirmed H7N9 infections in humans have been reported in eight contiguous provinces in eastern China (Anhui, Fujian, Henan, Hunan, Jiangsu, Jiangxi, Shandong and Zhejiang), two municipalities (Beijing and Shanghai) and Taiwan to date4. Although historically this subtype resulted in mild illness among humans3, the majority of novel A(H7N9) cases have resulted in severe respiratory illness in adults, representing the largest occurrence of H7 virus infections in humans2. Unlike highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) H5N1 viruses, which exhibit lethality in poultry and cause severe human disease, low pathogenic (LPAI) H7N9 viruses seem to be asymptomatic or cause mild disease in poultry and wild bird populations, possibly due to the presence of a single amino acid in the haemagglutinin (HA) cleavage site of this virus2,5. Similar to H5N1 viruses, human cases with H7N9 virus seem to result from direct contact with infected poultry, yet >20% of confirmed H7N9 cases have reported no exposure to live animals6. Although sustained human-to-human transmission has not been observed with this virus to date, reports of family clusters of A(H7N9) infection suggest the potential for virus spread between close contacts6. Understanding the properties of A(H7N9) viruses which contribute to human disease and their capacity for human-to-human transmission is a critical requirement for guidance of public health responses. The ferret (Mustela putorius furo) is recognized as the best small mammalian model for the concurrent study of influenza virus pathogenicity and transmissibility, and was used here to assess the virulence of A(H7N9) viruses. A/Anhui/1/13 (Anhui/1) virus was isolated from a throat-swab specimen collected from an adult female patient with known poultry exposure and who died from ARDS 6 days after illness onset. A/Shanghai/1/13 (Shanghai/1) virus was isolated from an adult male patient with no known poultry exposure who died from refractory hypoxemia 13 days after illness onset2. These A(H7N9) viruses from China possess several molecular markers previously associated with human adaptation, including the presence of E627K in the PB2 protein and Q226L in the 210-loop in the HA gene2. Glycan microarray analysis of these phylogenetically distinct viruses revealed that Shanghai/1 (bearing Q226 in the HA (H3 numbering)) largely binds to avian α2,3 receptor analogues (glycans 4 to 40) (Fig. 1a and Supplementary Table 1), whereas Anhui/1 virus (bearing L226), revealed a mixed α2,3/α2,6 receptor preference (Fig. 1b and Supplementary Table 1); the single Q226L amino substitution has long been recognized to modulate receptor-binding specificity7. In particular, Anhui/1 virus bound to human biantennary structures (glycans 43 to 47), as well as the longer, linear α2,6 sialylated tri-N-acetyl lactosamine (glycans 58–60), some of which have been detected in N glycans of cultured human bronchial epithelial cells8. These findings are in accord with recent studies showing that Anhui/1 virus binds to human tracheal tissue sections, albeit at a lower intensity than other human-adapted viruses9,10."
PMC7095140,2005-11-16,Dimensions of superspreading,"Analyses of contact-tracing data on the spread of infectious disease, combined with mathematical models, show that control measures require better knowledge of variability in individual infectiousness.","The SARS epidemic was notable for the existence of ‘superspreaders’ who infected dozens of people, whereas other infectious individuals infected few or none. Were SARS superspreaders anomalies, or are superspreaders characteristic of most infectious diseases? What effects does heterogeneity in infectiousness have on disease emergence and control? On page 355 of this issue, Lloyd-Smith et al.1 provide insight into such questions, and more. The first question any ecologist asks about an invasive species is what is the invader's intrinsic capacity for population increase? To answer this, the species' basic reproductive number, R0, is measured by the average number of offspring per capita that survive to reproductive age. For a directly transmitted infectious disease, be it polio, smallpox, SARS, HIV/AIDS or some newly emerging pathogen, R0 is the average number of infections produced by an infected individual in a susceptible population2. If R0 is less than one, a self-sustaining epidemic is not possible (at least without further pathogen evolution). If R0 exceeds one, then although early stochastic fluctuations may extinguish the invader, an epidemic is possible. If R0 is large, an epidemic is virtually certain."
PMC7097131,2016-01-21,Mathematical analysis of swine influenza epidemic model with optimal control,"A deterministic model is designed and used to analyze the transmission dynamics and the impact of antiviral drugs in controlling the spread of the 2009 swine influenza pandemic. In particular, the model considers the administration of the antiviral both as a preventive as well as a therapeutic agent. Rigorous analysis of the model reveals that its disease-free equilibrium is globally asymptotically stable under a condition involving the threshold quantity-reproduction number [Formula see text] . The disease persists uniformly if [Formula see text] and the model has a unique endemic equilibrium under certain condition. The model undergoes backward bifurcation if the antiviral drugs are completely efficient. Uncertainty and sensitivity analysis is presented to identify and study the impact of critical model parameters on the reproduction number. A time dependent optimal treatment strategy is designed using Pontryagin’s maximum principle to minimize the treatment cost and the infected population. Finally the reproduction number is estimated for the influenza outbreak and model provides a reasonable fit to the observed swine (H1N1) pandemic data in Manitoba, Canada, in 2009.","Influenza is a viral infection which is primarily transmitted through respiratory droplets produced by coughing and sneezing by an infected person [13, 41, 46]. Fever, cough, headache, muscle and joint pain, and reddened eyes are common symptoms of influenza. The infection, mostly prevalent in young children, elderly, pregnant women and patients with particular medical conditions such as chronic heart disease, has an initial incubation period of 1–4 days followed by a latency period of 2–10 days [33, 41, 46]. For the past few centuries, influenza remains a serious threat to public health around the globe [2, 13, 41, 46]. It is reported that an influenza epidemic might have occurred in the sixteenth century . During the past century, thousands of people lost their lives during three disastrous pandemics which include the Spanish flu, Asian flu, and Hong Kong flu during the year 1918, 1958, and 1968 respectively [2, 38, 46]. Most recently in 2014, India had reported 937 cases and 218 deaths from swine flu. The reported cases and deaths in 2015 had surpassed the previous numbers. The total number of confirmed cases crossed 33,000 with death of more than 2000 ."
PMC7099752,2016-05-23,Global dynamics for discrete-time analog of viral infection model with nonlinear incidence and CTL immune response,"In this paper, a discrete-time analog of a viral infection model with nonlinear incidence and CTL immune response is established by using the Micken non-standard finite difference scheme. The two basic reproduction numbers [Formula see text] and [Formula see text] are defined. The basic properties on the positivity and boundedness of solutions and the existence of the virus-free, the no-immune, and the infected equilibria are established. By using the Lyapunov functions and linearization methods, the global stability of the equilibria for the model is established. That is, when [Formula see text] then the virus-free equilibrium is globally asymptotically stable, and under the additional assumption [Formula see text] when [Formula see text] and [Formula see text] then the no-immune equilibrium is globally asymptotically stable and when [Formula see text] and [Formula see text] then the infected equilibrium is globally asymptotically stable. Furthermore, the numerical simulations show that even if assumption [Formula see text] does not hold, the no-immune equilibrium and the infected equilibrium also may be globally asymptotically stable.","As is well known, viruses have caused the abundant types of epidemics and are alive almost everywhere on Earth, infecting people, animals, plants, and so on. There are a large number of diseases, which are caused by viruses for example influenza, hepatitis, HIV, AIDS, SARS, Ebola, MERS. Therefore, it is important to study viral infection, which can supply theoretical evidence for controlling a disease to break out. In the past years, many authors have studied continuous time viral infection models which are described by the differential equations. See, for example, [1–28] and the references cited therein.

PMC7100214,2020-01-06,Dynamics analysis of a delayed virus model with two different transmission methods and treatments,"In this paper, a delayed virus model with two different transmission methods and treatments is investigated. This model is a time-delayed version of the model in (Zhang et al. in Comput. Math. Methods Med. 2015758362, 2015). We show that the virus-free equilibrium is locally asymptotically stable if the basic reproduction number is smaller than one, and by regarding the time delay as a bifurcation parameter, the existence of local Hopf bifurcation is investigated. The results show that time delay can change the stability of the endemic equilibrium. Finally, we give some numerical simulations to illustrate the theoretical findings.","Infectious diseases are still important diseases that endanger human health . Not only do some ancient infectious disease pathogens continue to mutate and change, but new pathogens are also emerging, bringing many difficulties for us to discover, diagnose, and prevent infectious diseases. Studies have shown that many diseases are caused by viruses. Of more than 4000 viruses discovered so far, more than 100 can directly threaten human health and life. For example, rabies, a zoonotic disease caused by rabies virus, can cause severe encephalitis. Because the virus invades the central nervous system, if the treatment is not taken in time, the mortality rate is almost 100%. Another example is the Ebola virus, which causes Ebola hemorrhagic fever with a mortality rate from 50% to 90%. In addition, recent research has shown that several viruses have been found to link with cancer in humans, even that can push the cell toward becoming cancerous, such as human papilloma viruses (HPVs) which are considered to be the biggest factor that causes various cancers such as cervical cancer [3–5], anal cancer [6, 7], and oropharyngeal cancers . The sudden outbreak of the SARS virus and the Ebola virus in the past 20 years has given us a major warning that public health issues are no longer just health issues, but also an important part of national security and urban security systems. Using mathematical models to help discover the mechanism of viral transmission to predict the development of infectious diseases has become the mainstream method for controlling and preventing infectious diseases [9–12]. Therefore, for over a century, lots of mathematical models have been established to explain the evolution of the free virus in a body, and mathematical analysis was implemented to explore the threshold associated with eradication and persistence of the virus; for example, [13–16] studied the global dynamic behavior of HIV models, [17–24] analysed the global dynamics of HBV models [25–28]. A general class of models describing the process of virus invading the target cells and release of the virus due to the infected cell apoptosis has been established and analyzed by Perelson et al.

Nosocomial infections were occasionally reported in healthcare settings. We report nosocomial cluster of Crimean–Congo haemorrhagic fever including the visitor with unknown transmission.","Crimean–Congo haemorrhagic fever (CCHF) is a severe, contagious haemorrhagic fever with a case fatality rate ranging from 3 to 30 %. It is caused by an RNA virus, belonging to the Nairovirus genus of the Bunyaviridae family. The principal mode of transmission of Crimean–Congo haemorrhagic fever virus (CCHFV) to humans is through an infected Hyalomma tick bite or through contact with blood, tissues or bodily fluids of another infected animal. Agricultural workers, shepherds, veterinarians, picnickers and the people involved in outdoor sports are at greater risk in endemic regions, such as Africa, the Balkans, the Middle East and Asian countries. Human-to-human transmission may occur through percutaneous or permucosal exposure to blood, tissues or other bodily fluids from infected persons [1, 2]. Nosocomial transmission is also possible in a similar way and poses a threat for healthcare workers (HCWs). Although the number of cases diagnosed as CCHF has been decreasing over the years, Turkey has encountered one of the largest epidemics in the world since the detection of the first case in 2002 . Only a few cases of nosocomial transmission of CCHF to healthcare workers have been reported till date . Most of these nosocomial cases bear histories of percutaneous injuries or contact with contaminated blood without adequate barrier precautions. Here, we report nosocomial cases of CCHF from visitors and healthcare workers even in the absence of a percutaneous injury or contact with contaminated body fluid. The cases were diagnosed at two different hospitals located in different cities. Nosocomial clustering of the CCHF cases was perceived during personal communications between the doctors. A 69-year-old male farmer was referred to the Department of Infectious Diseases and Clinical Microbiology at Ankara Training and Research Hospital after being diagnosed with CCHF from a secondary hospital at Kastamonu. He was suffering from fever, fatigue, nausea and vomiting for 3 days. He was living in Kastamonu, an endemic area, where he owned some cows and had received a tick bite on his back. He was hospitalised, isolated and administered supportive therapy under barrier nursing. His condition deteriorated as he developed respiratory and renal insufficiencies; he was intubated and mechanically ventilated, and died after 5 days of hospitalisation."
PMC7100524,2018-02-26,A discrete-time analog for coupled within-host and between-host dynamics in environmentally driven infectious disease,"In this paper, we establish a discrete-time analog for coupled within-host and between-host systems for an environmentally driven infectious disease with fast and slow two time scales by using the non-standard finite difference scheme. The system is divided into a fast time system and a slow time system by using the idea of limit equations. For the fast system, the positivity and boundedness of the solutions, the basic reproduction number and the existence for infection-free and unique virus infectious equilibria are obtained, and the threshold conditions on the local stability of equilibria are established. In the slow system, except for the positivity and boundedness of the solutions, the existence for disease-free, unique endemic and two endemic equilibria are obtained, and the sufficient conditions on the local stability for disease-free and unique endemic equilibria are established. To return to the coupling system, the local stability for the virus- and disease-free equilibrium, and virus infectious but disease-free equilibrium is established. The numerical examples show that an endemic equilibrium is locally asymptotically stable and the other one is unstable when there are two endemic equilibria.","As is well known, viruses have caused abundant types of epidemic and occur almost everywhere on Earth, infecting humans, animals, plants, and so on.

PMC7100848,2016-05-06,Global dynamics for a class of discrete SEIRS epidemic models with general nonlinear incidence,"In this paper, a class of discrete SEIRS epidemic models with general nonlinear incidence is investigated. Particularly, a discrete SEIRS epidemic model with standard incidence is also considered. The positivity and boundedness of solutions with positive initial conditions are obtained. It is shown that if the basic reproduction number [Formula see text] , then disease-free equilibrium is globally attractive, and if [Formula see text] , then the disease is permanent. When the model degenerates into SEIR model, it is proved that if [Formula see text] , then the model has a unique endemic equilibrium, which is globally attractive. Furthermore, the numerical examples verify an important open problem that when [Formula see text] , the endemic equilibrium of general SEIRS models is also globally attractive.","As is well known, many infectious diseases possess a latent period, such as Hepatitis, HIV, SARS, Ebola, MERS, etc. When a susceptible individual is infected at the beginning, the disease incubates inside the susceptible for a period of time, then the susceptible becomes an exposed individual before becoming infectious. For such infectious diseases, the resulting model is SEIR (susceptible S, exposed E, infectious I, removed R) epidemic type. The study on SEIR-type epidemic dynamical models is a very important subject in the mathematical theory of epidemiology, and in the last two decades there have been a number of researches on modeling, theoretical analysis, and applications. Continuous SEIR-type epidemic models described by the differential equations have been widely studied. Many important and interesting results can be found in [1–9] and the references therein. As we all know, it is very difficult to accurately solve a nonlinear differential equation with a given initial condition. Therefore, for many practical requirements, such as numerical calculation, it is often necessary to discretize a continuous model to obtain the corresponding discrete model. At the present time, there are various discretization methods to discretize a continuous model, including the standard methods, such as Euler method, Runge-Kutta method, and some other standard finite difference schemes, and the nonstandard finite difference (NSFD) scheme, which is originally developed by Mickens [10–12]."
PMC7110041,2009-02-15,Ability to replicate in the cytoplasm predicts zoonotic transmission of livestock viruses,"Understanding viral factors that promote cross-species transmission is important for evaluating the risk of zoonotic emergence. Weconstructed a database of viruses of domestic artiodactyls and examined the correlation between traits linked in the literature to cross-species transmission and the ability of viruses to infect humans. Among these traits-genomic material, genome segmentation, and replication without nuclear entry-the last is the strongest predictor of cross-species transmission. This finding highlights nuclear entry as a barrier to transmission and suggests that the ability to complete replication in the cytoplasm may prove to be a useful indicator of the threat of cross-species transmission.","Many emerging infections are caused by viruses that are transmitted between host species. Specific characteristics may preadapt some viral groups for cross-species transmission. If we can identify such characteristics, we can better prepare for future viral threats to humans, domestic animals, and wildlife that will emerge as interactions between potential host species change. Previous studies have compared emerging human pathogens to nonemerging human pathogens and looked for characteristics typical of those considered to be emerging [1–3]. To ask which characteristics predict host jumps requires a different approach. Specifically, we must examine the pool of other hosts' pathogens that a target species regularly encounters. From this pool we can compare the characteristics of microbes that are able to infect the target host versus those that manifest no evidence of an ability to infect the target host. Molecular characteristics that facilitate cross-species transmission are likely to be substantially different between viruses, bacteria, and protozoa, because of large differences in the pathobiology of these different taxa."
PMC7110139,2017-04-01,"Assessment of the Status of Measles Elimination in the United States, 2001–2014","We assessed the status of measles elimination in the United States using outbreak notification data. Measles transmissibility was assessed by estimation of the reproduction number, R, the average number of secondary cases per infection, using 4 methods; elimination requires maintaining R at <1. Method 1 estimates R as 1 minus the proportion of cases that are imported. Methods 2 and 3 estimate R by fitting a model of the spread of infection to data on the sizes and generations of chains of transmission, respectively. Method 4 assesses transmissibility before public health interventions, by estimating R for the case with the earliest symptom onset in each cluster (R(index)). During 2001–2014, R and R(index) estimates obtained using methods 1–4 were 0.72 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.68, 0.76), 0.66 (95% CI 0.62, 0.70), 0.45 (95% CI 0.40, 0.49), and 0.63 (95% CI 0.57, 0.69), respectively. Year-to-year variability in the values of R and R(index) and an increase in transmissibility in recent years were noted with all methods. Elimination of endemic measles transmission is maintained in the United States. A suggested increase in measles transmissibility since elimination warrants continued monitoring and emphasizes the importance of high measles vaccination coverage throughout the population.","Four standard mathematical methods were used to estimate R; details on the derivation of the formulas used in these methods are available elsewhere (9–11). These methods have been applied to assess measles transmissibility in several countries (9, 11–15) and to calculate R for a variety of other diseases (10, 16–18). Method 1 estimates R as 1 − P, where P is the proportion of cases that were imported. This method calculates the total number of cases arising from an importation as a geometric progression of cases per generation based on R. Methods 2 and 3 use a subcritical branching process that models the spread of an infection for a given value of R, and from which the expected distribution of chain sizes and durations can be calculated. One can then fit these models to the observed distribution of sizes (in method 2) and generations of spread (in method 3). The last formal assessment of measles transmissibility in the United States was performed for preelimination years 1997–1999 using these methods . Because public health response (e.g., quarantining, vaccination of susceptibles) can mitigate measles transmission and limit the number of secondary infections after importations and the size and duration of outbreaks, R as measured by the first 3 methods may be a reflection of both baseline immunity and control measures. Thus, we used a fourth estimation approach (method 4), originally developed to track changes in disease transmissibility over time , to assess transmissibility early during outbreaks, when public health interventions are unlikely to be in place. Specifically, we estimated the average number of secondary cases infected by the index case (i.e., the reproduction number of the index case (Rindex)), defined as the case with the earliest date of symptom onset in each cluster . Method 4 utilizes a likelihood-based estimation procedure that probabilistically infers “who infected whom” from the observed dates of symptom onset, based on the known distribution of the serial interval . The serial interval is the time from symptom onset in a primary case to symptom onset in a secondary case infected by that primary case ; based on household studies, the serial interval for measles is best described by a gamma probability distribution, with a mean of 11.1 days and a standard deviation of 2.47 days . Analyses were performed in R, version 3.0.2 (R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria). R was estimated for all years combined (2001–2014) and for each year individually. Maximum likelihood estimates of R and 95% profile likelihood confidence intervals were calculated for the first 3 methods. For method 4, a ready-to-use tool  was used to simulate 100 possible transmission trees for each cluster. Rindex was estimated as the probability-weighted average over all transmission trees of the number of cases that were in the second generation. We assigned Rindex = 0 in single cases . Combined and annual point estimates and confidence intervals were derived from likelihood functions based on a Poisson distribution with mean Rindex."

Surprisingly, we find that many groups with primary patient care responsibilities play a small role in spreading an infectious disease within our hospital data set. We also demonstrate that the effect of different network positions can be as important as the effect of different transmission rates for some categories of workers.","Traditionally, epidemiology research has focused on well-mixed (randomly mixed) populations where agent contacts are homogeneous. In these models, every agent in a population may “bump into” any other agent with equal probability, much as a gas molecule may bump into any other gas molecule with an equal probability over a fixed time period. Only recently have epidemiologists and other researchers begun to study the heterogeneous contact structures between people over which infectious diseases spread (early studies include Comins et al. 1992; Grenfell and Harwood 1997; Wallinga et al. 1999). We focus this study on healthcare workers and a particular class of infectious disease, of which influenza is an example. Healthcare workers are at especially high risk of contracting influenza. One study of healthcare workers with a low rate of influenza vaccination demonstrated that 23 % of healthcare workers had evidence of influenza infection during a single influenza season (Elder et al. 1996). Two features of influenza make its spread difficult to control in hospitals. First, people with influenza are infectious 1–4 days before the onset of symptoms. Thus, they can spread the virus when they are still feeling well and are unaware of their own infectious state. Second, only about 50 % of infected persons develop classic influenza symptoms (CDC 2002, 2003) Consequently, restricting healthcare workers with influenza-like symptoms from the workplace will not completely prevent transmission of influenza because healthcare workers with atypical symptoms could continue working and spreading the virus. Furthermore, studies show that healthcare workers are more likely than other workers to return to work early or to keep working when they have influenza-related symptoms (Weingarten et al. 1989)."
PMC7112450,2012-01-03,The impact of awareness on epidemic spreading in networks,"We explore the impact of awareness on epidemic spreading through a population represented by a scale-free network. Using a network mean-field approach, a mathematical model for epidemic spreading with awareness reactions is proposed and analyzed. We focus on the role of three forms of awareness including local, global, and contact awareness. By theoretical analysis and simulation, we show that the global awareness cannot decrease the likelihood of an epidemic outbreak while both the local awareness and the contact awareness can. Also, the influence degree of the local awareness on disease dynamics is closely related with the contact awareness.","During the outbreak of influenza A (H1N1) in 2009, the effect on human behaviors (such as
staying at home and wearing surgical face masks) not only due to public measures but also
due to individual responses was widely documented.1 When aware of an infectious disease outbreak, people will sometimes
change their behavior in order to reduce the risk of infection.2 Interestingly, the change of individual behaviors in the
presence of an infectious pathogen also has an effect on the epidemic spreading. Recently, there has been growing interest in investigating ways to model aspects of human
responses to disease outbreaks in epidemiological models including network epidemic
models3–5 and non-network epidemic
models.6–8 In general, individual
behaviors in the presence of an infectious pathogen respond to the information obtained from
the general circumstances. Following Funk et al.,4 such information may come from the social or spatial
neighborhood, which is called local (available) information. Another source of information
is from the media (e.g., the information published by public health authorities), called
global (available) information."
PMC7112454,2016-09-22,Effects of quasiperiodic forcing in epidemic models,"We study changes in the bifurcations of seasonally driven compartmental epidemic models, where the transmission rate is modulated temporally. In the presence of periodic modulation of the transmission rate, the dynamics varies from periodic to chaotic. The route to chaos is typically through period doubling bifurcation. There are coexisting attractors for some sets of parameters. However in the presence of quasiperiodic modulation, tori are created in place of periodic orbits and chaos appears via finite torus doublings. Strange nonchaotic attractors (SNAs) are created at the boundary of chaotic and torus dynamics. Multistability is found to be reduced as a function of quasiperiodic modulation strength. It is argued that occurrence of SNAs gives an opportunity of asymptotic predictability of epidemic growth even when the underlying dynamics is strange.","Seasonal variation in reported cases of infectious diseases, ranging from childhood
diseases (e.g., measles, diphtheria, and chickenpox) to infections affecting all ages like
influenza, cholera, and mosquito-borne diseases (e.g., malaria and dengue), is common across
temperate and tropical geographies.1–3 Although there is a growing body of literature1–6 investigating the role of external drivers
(e.g., rainfall, temperature, etc.) responsible for seasonal fluctuations in disease
incidence, a better understanding of the contributions of external (climate- or
environment-driven) versus internal (nonlinearity caused by immune responses in disease
dynamics itself) factors to the observed seasonality is lacking and clearly forms an active
area of research in the field of mathematical modelling and predictive epidemiology of
infectious diseases.6,7 In typical seasonally forced models of infectious diseases, the transmission rate (i.e.,
the per capita rate at which a susceptible individual interacts with an infectious
individual and acquires a new infection) is modulated in a periodic fashion using a sine or
cosine function.1–3,8,9
(However, see Refs. 7 and 10 for an exception to this rule.) Although periodic forcing in the
transmission term helps explain most of the observed seasonality in disease data, external
drivers themselves may not be periodic or, at least, may not remain periodic over time.6,11,12 Instead, these external drivers
may have anomalies in the amplitude and/or onset of the peaks that occur in different years.
Such irregular dynamic behaviour cannot be captured by a simple sinusoidal function.6"
PMC7112456,2015-09-17,Interplay between the local information based behavioral responses and the epidemic spreading in complex networks,"The spreading of an infectious disease can trigger human behavior responses to the disease, which in turn plays a crucial role on the spreading of epidemic. In this study, to illustrate the impacts of the human behavioral responses, a new class of individuals, S(F), is introduced to the classical susceptible-infected-recovered model. In the model, S(F) state represents that susceptible individuals who take self-initiate protective measures to lower the probability of being infected, and a susceptible individual may go to S(F) state with a response rate when contacting an infectious neighbor. Via the percolation method, the theoretical formulas for the epidemic threshold as well as the prevalence of epidemic are derived. Our finding indicates that, with the increasing of the response rate, the epidemic threshold is enhanced and the prevalence of epidemic is reduced. The analytical results are also verified by the numerical simulations. In addition, we demonstrate that, because the mean field method neglects the dynamic correlations, a wrong result based on the mean field method is obtained—the epidemic threshold is not related to the response rate, i.e., the additional S(F) state has no impact on the epidemic threshold.","Since network models can well describe the spreading of infectious disease among
populations, many efforts have been devoted to studying this field.1,2 At first, researchers mainly paid attention to analyze
the impact of the network structure on epidemic spreading and the control strategies, for
example, how the network topology affects the epidemic threshold and the prevalence of
epidemic,3–8 or how to
design an effective immunization strategy to control the outbreaks of epidemics.9,10 In reality, outbreaks of epidemics can
trigger spontaneous behavioral responses of individuals to take preventive measures, which
in turn alters the epidemic dynamics and affects the disease transmission process.11–17 Thus, recently,
some studies have made attempts to evaluate the impact of the human behaviors on epidemic
dynamics. For instance, Funk et al.18 studied the impacts of awareness spread on both epidemic threshold
and prevalence, and they found that, in a well-mixed population, spread of awareness can
reduce the prevalence of epidemic but does not tend to affect the epidemic threshold, yet
the epidemic threshold is altered when considering on social networks; Sahneh et
al. considered a Susceptible-Alter-Infected-Susceptible (SAIS)
model,19 and they found that the way of
behavioral response can enhance the epidemic threshold; Meloni et al.
constructed a meta-population model incorporating several scenarios of self-initiated
behavioral changes into the mobility patterns of individuals, and they found that such
behavioral changes do not alter the epidemic threshold, but may increase rather than
decrease the prevalence of epidemic.20
Meanwhile, in Ref. 21, by designing the transmission
rate of epidemic as a function of the local infected density or the global infected density,
Wu et al. investigated the effect of such a behavioral response on the
epidemic threshold. One fact is that the infectious neighbors can infect a susceptible individual, also
triggering the awareness of the susceptible individual.19,22 In view of this, in Ref. 23, Perra et al. introduced a new class of individuals,
SF, that represents susceptible people who self-initiate
behavioral changes that lead to a reduction in the transmissibility of the infectious
disease, into the classical SIR model, and they found that such a model
(SSFIR) can induce a rich phase space with multiple epidemic
peaks and tipping points. However, the network structure was not incorporated into these
models. As we know, when the model is considered within the network based framework, new
theoretical tools should be used and new phenomena may be observed. In view of this, we
incorporate the network structure into the SSFIR model23 to investigate its spreading dynamics. In
the model, when contacting an infectious neighbor, susceptible individuals may be infected
(from S state I state) with a transmission rate, or a
behavioral response may be triggered (from S state to
SF state) with a response rate. We provide a theoretical
formula for the epidemic threshold as well as the prevalence of epidemic via the percolation
method,5 our results show that the
introduction of SF class can enhance the epidemic threshold and
reduce the prevalence of epidemic. We also demonstrate that a wrong result can be
obtained—the introduction of SF class cannot alter the epidemic
threshold when using mean field method to such a model. The reasons are presented in Sec.
V."
PMC7112474,2013-10-10,Inhomogeneity of epidemic spreading with entropy-based infected clusters,"Considering the difference in the sizes of the infected clusters in the dynamic complex networks, the normalized entropy based on infected clusters ([Formula see text]) is proposed to characterize the inhomogeneity of epidemic spreading. [Formula see text] gives information on the variability of the infected clusters in the system. We investigate the variation in the inhomogeneity of the distribution of the epidemic with the absolute velocity v of moving agent, the infection density ρ, and the interaction radius r. By comparing [Formula see text] in the dynamic networks with [Formula see text] in homogeneous mode, the simulation experiments show that the inhomogeneity of epidemic spreading becomes smaller with the increase of v, ρ, r.","The studied models of the epidemic spreading have greatly improved the public's
understanding of infection mechanisms.1–6 Among the most studied models for investigating the spread of
epidemic, susceptible-infected-susceptible (SIS) and susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR)
epidemic models are two famous epidemiological models.7,8 When studying the epidemic spreading with these models in complex
networks, researchers often adopt homogeneous mixing hypotheses9–12 which each infected agent has same probability
of contact with any susceptible agent. However, such a hypothesis is not strong and should
be thoroughly discussed. Recently, researchers have discussed the credibility of the
hypothesis. For instance, Liu et al. implement the distribution of an
epidemic is always inhomogeneous after the transition process in Refs. 13 and 14, where they present the characteristic infected cluster
size (CICS), which characterizes the inhomogeneity of the epidemic spreading. However, the
CICS measurement studied on the typical size of the largest infected cluster, which cannot
reflect the infected clusters. Entropy is a fundamental concept in physics. It is related to the information content and
order/disorder of a system. In statistical physics, cluster entropy has been used in the
study of problems, such as percolation15,16 and complex systems. Cluster entropy was utilized within the
Axelrod model to measures the number of cultural groups of different sizes.17 Cluster-size entropy was also used in the
Axelrod's cultural adaptation model which gives information on the variability of the
cultural cluster size present in the system.18 In the paper, the normalized entropy based on infected clusters
(δ*)
can reflect the variability of the infected clusters in dynamic model. In addition in order
to characterize the inhomogeneity of the epidemic spreading, we denote the Homogeneous
Mode13 where all the infected agents are
randomly distributed and keep static in the system, is used to represent the case where the
epidemic is homogeneously distributed. For the convenience of discussion, we denote the
δ*
of homogeneous mode as δH*.
Therefore, for given infection density ρ, the larger
|δ*−δH*|
is, the more inhomogeneous the epidemic spreading is."
PMC7112481,2014-10-20,Suppression of epidemic spreading in complex networks by local information based behavioral responses,"The interplay between individual behaviors and epidemic dynamics in complex networks is a topic of recent interest. In particular, individuals can obtain different types of information about the disease and respond by altering their behaviors, and this can affect the spreading dynamics, possibly in a significant way. We propose a model where individuals' behavioral response is based on a generic type of local information, i.e., the number of neighbors that has been infected with the disease. Mathematically, the response can be characterized by a reduction in the transmission rate by a factor that depends on the number of infected neighbors. Utilizing the standard susceptible-infected-susceptible and susceptible-infected-recovery dynamical models for epidemic spreading, we derive a theoretical formula for the epidemic threshold and provide numerical verification. Our analysis lays on a solid quantitative footing the intuition that individual behavioral response can in general suppress epidemic spreading. Furthermore, we find that the hub nodes play the role of “double-edged sword” in that they can either suppress or promote outbreak, depending on their responses to the epidemic, providing additional support for the idea that these nodes are key to controlling epidemic spreading in complex networks.","Epidemic spreading in complex networks often occurs in an extremely interactive manner.
Consider, for example, the spread of a virus. When individuals become aware of the potential
disease, they would take preventive measures (e.g., using better hygiene, wearing protective
masks, or avoiding congested public places) to protect themselves and those around them. In
this sense, individuals in the network cannot be treated as “passive” nodes awaiting to be
infected but they can in fact be quite “reactive” to the spreading dynamics. Such human
behavioral responses can have significant effects on the epidemic dynamics,1–5 a topic of great recent
interest.6–14 The individual reactions to an epidemic often rely on detailed information about the
disease. Broadly, there are two types of information local or global.15 For example, news obtained from the social neighborhood of
an individual is local, but information from the mass media or from the public health
authorities can be regarded as global. The influences of local16–20 or global21–23 information based behavioral responses, or
awareness, on the epidemic dynamics can in general be quite different, and there is also
recent work on the effects of combined local and global information based awareness.24–27 Quantitatively, the impact
of different types of information-based awareness can be characterized by how they modify
the epidemic threshold and the final epidemic size (or epidemic prevalence). For example,
Bagnoli et al.26 assumed
that individuals' risk perception of epidemic is an exponential function of local and global
information, and they showed that a nonlinear increase in the perception risk can lead to
extinction of the disease. Funk et al.17 studied the impacts of awareness spread on both epidemic threshold
and prevalence and found that, in a well-mixed population, spread of awareness can reduce
the outbreak size but does not tend to affect the epidemic threshold. This result, however,
does not appear to hold for social networks for which the mixed-population assumption is not
valid. In particular, Wu et al.24 compared the roles of the three forms of information-based
awareness, i.e., local, global, and contact awareness, in the epidemic threshold, and
concluded that global awareness cannot alter the epidemic threshold, while both local and
contact awareness can. Sahneh et al.6,7 proved that local information-based response can enhance the
epidemic threshold and reduce the prevalence, given that the probability of susceptible
individuals to alter their state is proportional to the number of the infected
neighbors."
PMC7112482,2014-05-14,Epidemic spreading in time-varying community networks,"The spreading processes of many infectious diseases have comparable time scale as the network evolution. Here, we present a simple networks model with time-varying community structure, and investigate susceptible-infected-susceptible epidemic spreading processes in this model. By both theoretic analysis and numerical simulations, we show that the efficiency of epidemic spreading in this model depends intensively on the mobility rate q of the individuals among communities. We also find that there exists a mobility rate threshold q(c). The epidemic will survive when q > q(c) and die when q < q(c). These results can help understanding the impacts of human travel on the epidemic spreading in complex networks with community structure.","Epidemic spreading, including the spreading of human diseases, rumors, and computer
viruses, has been one of the most prolific fields in complex network dynamics.1,2 Large research effort has recently been
devoted to the study of the susceptible-infected-susceptible (SIS) epidemic model, where
each vertex belongs to one of two states, either susceptible or infected.3 Mathematical analysis on such model has
revealed the importance of topology for propagation dynamics, such as lack of an epidemic
threshold on scale-free networks.4,5
These studies assumed the network evolves more slowly than the diffusion process. The system
can be modeled as a static network basing on this assumption, which is effective in many
circumstances, such as the spread of the computer viruses, traffic dynamics, and the
propagation of some diseases which spread rapidly. However, the propagation of many
infectious diseases has comparable time scale as fluctuation of the networks topology, such
as tuberculosis, foot and mouth disease among cattle, and various sexually transmitted
infections.6–9 In recent years, there have been extensive research activities on time-varying networks, or
called temporal networks, which evolve on a time scale comparable to the time scale of the
propagation process.10–12 An
additional time dimension is considered in time-varying networks. At every time step, an
instance of a time-varying network is formed. All these network instances for many time
steps can be aggregated to a static network. An excellent overview of the various
applications of temporal networks in many disciplines can be found in Ref. 10. More recently, Hoppe et al. have
investigated mutual selection in time-varying networks.11 Kotnis et al. found the existence of an “adaptive
threshold,” on adaptive time-varying networks.12 Gong et al. have investigated the time-varying
human mobility patterns with metapopulation epidemic dynamics.13 Starnini et al. have investigated the
immunization strategies for epidemic processes in time-varying contact networks.14 All these investigations indicate that
time-varying networks play an important role in the investigation of the epidemic spreading
that occurs on complex networks."
PMC7112487,2016-06-14,Cooperative spreading processes in multiplex networks,"This study is concerned with the dynamic behaviors of epidemic spreading in multiplex networks. A model composed of two interacting complex networks is proposed to describe cooperative spreading processes, wherein the virus spreading in one layer can penetrate into the other to promote the spreading process. The global epidemic threshold of the model is smaller than the epidemic thresholds of the corresponding isolated networks. Thus, global epidemic onset arises in the interacting networks even though an epidemic onset does not arise in each isolated network. Simulations verify the analysis results and indicate that cooperative spreading processes in multiplex networks enhance the final infection fraction.","Epidemic spreading, which is an important dynamic process in complex networks, has
attracted great attention for a long time. Many studies initially focused on isolated
networks of fixed topology with mean-field approximation.1,2 The spread of sexually transmitted diseases and computer viruses
was studied based on scale-free networks.3–6 Several studies also revealed that epidemic processes in
scale-free networks do not pose an epidemic threshold because of large connectivity
fluctuations in infinite scale-free networks.7–9 Epidemic spreading was investigated in complex random networks
with degree correlations.10 Then,
reaction-diffusion model in which the nodes contain agents11–14 was used in the process of spreading. The
agents can move from a node to another, and spreading processes occurred within agents on
the same node. Further, the studies focus on the mobility of individuals.15,16 The movement of individuals among
dense crowd in a city has a great effect on the epidemic threshold. A random diffusion model
was also used to investigate epidemic spreading among objective traveling people.17,18 The railway leads to a fast increase
in the number of infected agents and a high final infection fraction. These models and
results are very useful for public health authorities to make effective decisions. However, many spreading processes have been studied independently in a single network. In
the real-world, many spreading processes can occur through multiple routes simultaneously.
For example, sexually transmitted diseases can spread both in homosexual and heterosexual
networks.19 Avian influenza, such as
2009 H1N1 and 2013 H7N9, has recently made dead-end jumps from poultry to human.20 Thus, these viruses make challenges to
human progress and survival. A natural extension is to use the interacting network model in
which epidemic can spread from one network to another. Funk and Jansen21 used the bond percolation analysis of two competitive
viruses in two-layer networks, and the effects of layer overlapping were investigated. A
study on U.S. bisexual men showed that the bisexual men were the medium to connect the
pathogens from the network of heterosexual men with the network of homosexual men.22,23 Dickison et
al.24 studied the
susceptible-infected-refractory (SIR) process and revealed that in strongly coupled
networks, epidemics spread from one layer to the other at a critical infection strength
βc, below which the disease does not spread.
Saumell-Mendiola et al.25
analyzed an epidemic spreading process of two interacting networks. They also developed a
heterogeneous mean-field approach and revealed that a global endemic state may arise in the
coupled system even though two networks are well below their respective epidemic thresholds.
Granell et al.26 used a
microscopic Markov chain approach to analyze the interrelation between two processes,
namely, the spreading of the epidemic and the spreading of information awareness to prevent
infection. They also determined that awareness spread leads to disease suppression. Zhao
et al.27 used bond
percolation theory and the generating function with SIR model to calculate the epidemic
thresholds of multiplex networks. Sahneh and Scoglio28 extended the single-virus spread model to the two exclusive
viruses in two-layer networks, and they found analytical expressions that determine
extinction, coexistence, and absolute dominance of the viruses. Zhao et
al.29 promoted the concept of
state-dependent infected rate, and all the different influences between the two epidemics
were displayed. Therefore, epidemic spreading processes on top of multiplex networks reveal
a rich phase diagram of intertwined effects."
PMC7112518,2012-11-26,Interplay between collective behavior and spreading dynamics on complex networks,"There are certain correlations between collective behavior and spreading dynamics on some real complex networks. Based on the dynamical characteristics and traditional physical models, we construct several new bidirectional network models of spreading phenomena. By theoretical and numerical analysis of these models, we find that the collective behavior can inhibit spreading behavior, but, conversely, this spreading behavior can accelerate collective behavior. The spread threshold of spreading network is obtained by using the Lyapunov function method. The results show that an effective spreading control method is to enhance the individual awareness to collective behavior. Many real-world complex networks can be thought of in terms of both collective behavior and spreading dynamics and therefore to better understand and control such complex networks systems, our work may provide a basic framework.","It is well known that many real biological and social systems can be considered as
dynamical complex networks. For examples, the daily activities of cows (eating, lying down,
and standing) can be modeled by a dynamical network, where local dynamics of each cow is
described by an oscillator of a piecewise linear dynamical system.1 The authors in Ref. 1
not only studied interesting dynamics such as synchronization but also developed some
biological predictions. Many other examples can be found in Ref. 2. Now, let us ask when an infectious disease spreads among these cows,
what is the impact on their synchronous behavior? Can then this synchronous behavior weaken
or strengthen the disease spread process? We feel that these problems can be resolved by
examining the interplay between the collective and spreading dynamics on complex
networks. It is an interesting and important topic to consider the interplay between different
dynamical behaviors appearing in complex networks. The correlation between traffic flow and
epidemic spreading on complex networks was investigated numerically and theoretically in
Ref. 3, for the case where the epidemic incidence was
shaped by traffic-flow conditions and epidemic pathways were defined and driven by flows.
The results in Ref. 3 provided a general framework for
us to understand the spreading processes on complex traffic networks. We have investigated
mathematically the correlation between the dynamical synchronization and the epidemic
behavior on complex networks,4 and a very
explicit condition for synchronization with respect to the epidemic rate was obtained.
However, in this case, we only considered a special collective behavior, i.e., global
synchronization. Moreover, the correlation between the dynamical synchronization and the
epidemic behavior is unidirectional, i.e., the spreading behavior can influence the
dynamical synchronization, but not vice versa. So, in this paper, we will extend our former
research work to consider that the correlation between the collective behavior and the
spread behavior is bidirectional and address further phase synchronization which may be a
more general collective behavior."
PMC7115222,2020-03-18,Symbolic transfer entropy reveals the age structure of pandemic influenza transmission from high-volume influenza-like illness data,"Existing methods to infer the relative roles of age groups in epidemic transmission can normally only accommodate a few age classes, and/or require data that are highly specific for the disease being studied. Here, symbolic transfer entropy (STE), a measure developed to identify asymmetric transfer of information between stochastic processes, is presented as a way to reveal asymmetric transmission patterns between age groups in an epidemic. STE provides a ranking of which age groups may dominate transmission, rather than a reconstruction of the explicit between-age-group transmission matrix. Using simulations, we establish that STE can identify which age groups dominate transmission even when there are differences in reporting rates between age groups and even if the data are noisy. Then, the pairwise STE is calculated between time series of influenza-like illness for 12 age groups in 884 US cities during the autumn of 2009. Elevated STE from 5 to 19 year-olds indicates that school-aged children were likely the most important transmitters of infection during the autumn wave of the 2009 pandemic in the USA. The results may be partially confounded by higher rates of physician-seeking behaviour in children compared to adults, but it is unlikely that differences in reporting rates can explain the observed differences in STE.","Age is a key predictor of a person’s rate of both acquiring [1–6] and transmitting [1,7,8] influenza. Children tend to contribute more to influenza transmission than adults do [1,4,7], but the precise epidemiological roles of different age groups can shift from season to season  and may change markedly in pandemic years . From a public health perspective, untangling the relative roles of different age groups could help guide targeted vaccination strategies [7,11–13] and other age-related interventions, like the selective closure of schools [14–16]. However, data with sufficient resolution to identify detailed epidemiological relationships between age groups have so far been scarce, and even when such data exist, current methods are insufficient for reliably uncovering those relationships. Electronic medical records (EMRs) help address the issue of data scarcity by providing high-volume influenza-like illness (ILI) incidence data with detailed age structure . EMRs are routinely produced by physicians for insurance purposes during the majority of outpatient visits in the USA . Since EMRs generally contain syndromic illness classifications, EMR-based estimates of influenza incidence are subject to noise from non-ILI respiratory infection. EMR-based disease incidence estimates are also subject to geographical and demographic variation in physician-seeking behaviour. Laboratory-confirmed influenza cases, as collected routinely by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) , provide more specific estimates of influenza incidence, but at substantially lower volume. Influenza incidence estimates from online search platforms and social media websites like Google  and Twitter  can provide massive amounts of data, but the reliability of these sources has been called into question, and they lack detailed age information . Dedicated online platforms such as FluNearYou in the USA and FluSurvey in the UK, which gather reports of ILI symptoms from community volunteers [22,23], hold some promise for supplementing traditional ILI data streams [24–26], but represent a relatively small convenience sample of the population. So, while other data sources exist, EMRs offer a relatively promising and so-far underused source of fine-scale data on influenza incidence in the USA [17,21]."
PMC7117777,2020-03-23,Tracking progress towards malaria elimination in China: Individual-level estimates of transmission and its spatiotemporal variation using a diffusion network approach,"In order to monitor progress towards malaria elimination, it is crucial to be able to measure changes in spatio-temporal transmission. However, common metrics of malaria transmission such as parasite prevalence are under powered in elimination contexts. China has achieved major reductions in malaria incidence and is on track to eliminate, having reporting zero locally-acquired malaria cases in 2017 and 2018. Understanding the spatio-temporal pattern underlying this decline, especially the relationship between locally-acquired and imported cases, can inform efforts to maintain elimination and prevent re-emergence. This is particularly pertinent in Yunnan province, where the potential for local transmission is highest. Using a geo-located individual-level dataset of cases recorded in Yunnan province between 2011 and 2016, we introduce a novel Bayesian framework to model a latent diffusion process and estimate the joint likelihood of transmission between cases and the number of cases with unobserved sources of infection. This is used to estimate the case reproduction number, Rc. We use these estimates within spatio-temporal geostatistical models to map how transmission varied over time and space, estimate the timeline to elimination and the risk of resurgence. We estimate the mean Rc between 2011 and 2016 to be 0.171 (95% CI = 0.165, 0.178) for P. vivax cases and 0.089 (95% CI = 0.076, 0.103) for P. falciparum cases. From 2014 onwards, no cases were estimated to have a Rc value above one. An unobserved source of infection was estimated to be moderately likely (p>0.5) for 19/ 611 cases and high (p>0.8) for 2 cases, suggesting very high levels of case ascertainment. Our estimates suggest that, maintaining current intervention efforts, Yunnan is unlikely to experience sustained local transmission up to 2020. However, even with a mean of 0.005 projected up to 2020, locally-acquired cases are possible due to high levels of importation.","In 2016 the World Health Organisation listed 21 countries for whom it would be realistic to achieve elimination of malaria by 2020, defined as zero indigenous cases over three consecutive years . The largest of these is the People’s Republic of China (thereafter called China). In 2017 China reported no indigenous malaria cases for the first time since malaria became a notifiable disease in 1956 [2,3]. The country has experienced a major decline in the burden of malaria, from an annual incidence of 24 million cases (2961 cases per 100,000) in 1970 . This reduction has been attributed to a combination of socioeconomic improvements and the scale-up of interventions to control malaria . In 2010, China set out an ambitious plan for the national elimination of malaria by 2020 (the National Malaria Elimination Programme, NMEP). Elements of the plan included improved surveillance, timely response, more effective and sensitive risk assessment tools and improved diagnostics . A key policy change implemented in 2010 as part of the NMEP was the introduction of the 1-3-7 system aiming for case reporting in one day, which is then investigated within three days, with a focused investigation and action taken in under seven days . Although China is making rapid progress towards this goal, 2,675 imported cases were reported in 2017, highlighting the risk of re-introduction . Large numbers of people move between China and malaria endemic countries, both from sub-Saharan Africa and from South East Asia [8,9], driven by tourism and Chinese oversea investment . Concerns remain about re-emergence of malaria, which has occurred several times in the early 2000s as a result of importation and favourable climatic conditions for competent vectors . Therefore, in order to achieve three consecutive years of zero indigenous cases (the requirement for WHO certification of elimination), a sustained and targeted investment in surveillance together with efficient treatment is necessary."
PMC7126980,2005-11-02,Application of transmission electron microscopy to the clinical study of viral and bacterial infections: Present and future,"Transmission electron microscopy has had a profound impact on our knowledge and understanding of viruses and bacteria. The 1000-fold improvement in resolution provided by electron microscopy (EM) has allowed visualization of viruses, the existence of which had previously only been suspected as the causative agents of transmissible infectious disease. Viruses are grouped into families based on their morphology. Viruses from different families look different and these morphological variances are the basis for identification of viruses by EM. Electron microscopy initially came to prominence in diagnostic microbiology in the late 1960s when it was used in the rapid diagnosis of smallpox, by differentiating, on a morphological basis, poxviruses from the less problematic herpesviruses in skin lesions. Subsequently, the technique was employed in the diagnosis of other viral infections, such as hepatitis B and parvovirus B19. Electron microscopy has led to the discovery of many new viruses, most notably the various viruses associated with gastroenteritis, for which it remained the principal diagnostic method until fairly recent times. Development of molecular techniques, which offer greater sensitivity and often the capacity to easily process large numbers of samples, has replaced EM in many areas of diagnostic virology. Hence the role of EM in clinical virology is evolving with less emphasis on diagnosis and more on research, although this is likely only to be undertaken in specialist centres. However, EM still offers tremendous advantages to the microbiologist, both in the speed of diagnosis and the potential for detecting, by a single test, any viral pathogen or even multiple pathogens present within a sample. There is continuing use of EM for the investigation of new and emerging agents, such as SARS and human monkeypox virus. Furthermore, EM forms a vital part of the national emergency response programme of many countries and will provide a frontline diagnostic service in the event of a bioterrorism incident, particularly in the scenario of a deliberate release of smallpox virus. In the field of bacteriology, EM is of little use diagnostically, although some bacterial pathogens can be identified in biopsy material processed for EM examination. Electron microscopy has been used, however, to elucidate the structure and function of many bacterial features, such as flagellae, fimbriae and spores and in the study of bacteriophages. The combined use of EM and gold-labelled antibodies provides a powerful tool for the ultrastructural localisation of bacterial and viral antigens.","Prior to the development of the transmission electron microscope, cells and bacteria could be observed by light microscopy, but the only viruses that could be visualised were the poxviruses. Although poxviruses were the largest of the viruses known at that time (approximately 250 nm), no morphological detail could be seen under an optimally adjusted light microscope. The resolution limit of light microscopy of approximately 200 nm formed a barrier to visualising all other viruses and bacterial ultrastructure. The transmission electron microscope (TEM) or ‘supermicroscope’ (Gabor, 1945) was first described by Max Knoll and Ernst Ruska in 1932 (Knoll and Ruska, 1932). The successful development of the TEM, with its resolution limit of about one thousand times greater than the light microscope and the subsequent, albeit limited, availability of commercial electron microscopes post 1945, revolutionised many aspects of virology and microbiology. Ernst Ruska's brother Helmut, was one of the first workers to visualise viruses (Kruger et al., 2000). Key events in the development of electron microscopy have recently been reviewed by Haguenau and colleagues (Haguenau et al., 2003). To fully exploit the potential of the TEM, new methods for specimen preparation and new procedures for fixation, embedding, sectioning and staining were developed (Nermut et al., 1987, Harris, 1997). Since viruses and bacteria are very small, it was also necessary to develop thin films to coat EM specimen grids to support these organisms. Early imaging of viruses and bacteria was accomplished by depositing metal atoms onto the organisms to provide the necessary contrast for their visualisation this was known as the ‘shadow casting’ technique. The introduction of negative contrast staining, using solutions of heavy metal salts, greatly simplified specimen preparation and revealed far greater detail in the ultrastructure of viruses and bacteria (Brenner and Horne, 1959). Increased commercial production of TEMs made the instruments available to many institutions, including universities and hospital laboratories and, together with the new specimen preparation methods, allowed investigation of a whole range of infectious diseases. Use of transmission electron microscopy for the study of micro-organisms peaked during the period 1970–1980 when it contributed to the discovery of several new viruses. Biological and medical journals of that era feature significant numbers of papers describing ultrastructural investigations of disease pathogenesis involving the study of many viruses and bacteria and their interaction with a range of cells and tissues."
PMC7132999,2020-04-05,Evaluating the impact of the weather conditions on the influenza propagation," Predicting the details of how an epidemic evolves is highly valuable as health institutions need to better plan towards limiting the infection propagation effects and optimizing their prediction and response capabilities. Simulation is a cost- and time-effective way of predicting the evolution of the infection as the joint influence of many different factors interaction patterns, personal characteristics, travel patterns, meteorological conditions, previous vaccination, etc. The work presented in this paper extends EpiGraph, our influenza epidemic simulator, by introducing a meteorological model as a modular component that interacts with the rest of EpiGraph’s modules to refine our previous simulation results. Our goal is to estimate the effects of changes in temperature and relative humidity on the patterns of epidemic influenza based on data provided by the Spanish Influenza Sentinel Surveillance System (SISSS) and the Spanish Meteorological Agency (AEMET). METHODS Our meteorological model is based on the regression model developed by AB and JS, and it is tuned with influenza surveillance data obtained from SISSS. After pre-processing this data to clean it and reconstruct missing samples, we obtain new values for the reproduction number of each urban region in Spain, every 10 minutes during 2011. We simulate the propagation of the influenza by setting the date of the epidemic onset and the initial influenza-illness rates for each urban region. RESULTS We show that the simulation results have the same propagation shape as the weekly influenza rates as recorded by SISSS. We perform experiments for a realistic scenario based on actual meteorological data from 2010-2011, and for synthetic values assumed under simplified predicted climate change conditions. Results show that a diminishing relative humidity of 10% produces an increment of about 1.6% in the final infection rate. The effect of temperature changes on the infection spread is also noticeable, with a decrease of 1.1% per extra degree.Conclusions Using a tool like ours could help predict the shape of developing epidemics and its peaks, and would permit to quickly run scenarios to determine the evolution of the epidemic under different conditions. We make EpiGraph source code and epidemic data publicly available.","Seasonal influenza may not make headlines, but together with pneumonia, it is one of the top ten causes of death worldwide. Influenza epidemics results in 3 to 5 million cases of severe illness a year, which puts a high burden on health providers and results in loss of productivity and absenteeism, such as mentioned by the World Health Organization in . It‘s been long known that in temperate climates these seasonal epidemics occur mostly in winter, and typical hypotheses assigned the blame to people being in closer proximity for longer periods of time, or lowered immune systems. In general, meteorological conditions affect virus transmission due to multiple effects virus survival rates, host contact rates and immunity, and the transmission environment (except the case of direct or short-range contact). While these factors may have an influence, the solid evidence sustains the hypothesis that the virus‘s best surviving conditions are low temperatures and low absolute humidity. One of the goals of the current research in this field is to understand this relationship to be able to develop a more accurate seasonal influenza model for both temperate and tropical regions. As a motivation of this work, JT et al.  conclude that environment factors may become more important for a future predictive model of the effects of climate change. In a previous paper , some of the authors of this paper studied the interaction of the spatio-temporal distribution of influenza in Spain and the meteorological conditions during five consecutive influenza seasons. The work uses real influenza and meteorological data in combination with statistical models to show that there is a relationship between the transmission of influenza and meteorological variables like absolute humidity and amount of rainfall. In this work we use the same data sources (SISSS and AEMET agencies) following a different approach we study some of these relationships from a simulation perspective, considering not only the existing influenza distributions but also the ones related to the climate change. In this work we extend EpiGraph , an influenza simulator, with a meteorological model (MM) starting from the model developed by AB and JS . In their paper AB and JS analyze monthly weather and influenza mortality data collected between 1973 and 2002 throughout all of the 359 US urban counties. Using a regression model, they conclude that there exist correlations between both absolute humidity and temperature with mortality. They report a quantitative assessment of the relation between mean daily humidity and temperature levels and mortality rates in different ranges. This is an extensive study and, as a result, we start from the assumption that their results are solid and appropriate to incorporate to EpiGraph in order to produce meteorological-dependent simulations based on real data.

PMC7133616,2017-02-24,A patchy model for the transmission dynamics of tuberculosis in sub-Saharan Africa,"Tuberculosis (TB) spreads through contact between a susceptible person and smear positive pulmonary TB case (TPM+). The spread of TB is highly dependent on people migration between cities or regions that may have different contact rates and different environmental parameters, leading to different disease spread speed in the population. In this work, a metapopulation model, i.e., networks of populations connected by migratory flows, which overcomes the assumption of homogeneous mixing between different regions was constructed. The TB model was combined to a simple demographic structure for the population living in a multi-patch environment (cities, towns, regions or countries). The model consist of a system of differential equations coupling TB epidemic at different strength and mobility between the patches. Constant recruitment rate, slow and fast progression to the disease, effective chemoprophylaxis, diagnostic and treatment are taken into account to make the model including the reality of people in the sub-Saharan African countries. The basic reproduction number ([Formula see text] ) was computed and it was demonstrated that the disease-free equilibrium is globally asymptotically stable if [Formula see text] . When [Formula see text] , the disease-free equilibrium is unstable and there exists one endemic equilibrium. Moreover, the impact of increasing migration rate between patches on the TB spread was quantified using numerical implementation of the model. Using an example on 15 inter-connected patches on the same road, we demonstrated that most people was most likely to get infected if the disease starts in a patch in the middle than in border patches.","Tuberculosis (abbreviated as TB for tubercle bacillus) is a common deadly infectious disease caused mainly by the Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) that primarily attacks the lungs (pulmonary TB). TB can also affect the central nervous system, the circulatory system, the genital-urinary system, bones, joints and even the skin. MTB spreads mostly through contact with active pulmonary TB persons, although [1, 2] and not from latently infected persons. MTB transmission depends on the number of infectious droplets expelled by a carrier, the effectiveness of ventilation, duration of the exposure and virulence of the MTB strain [1–5]. The transmission chain can therefore be broken by isolating patients with active disease and starting effective anti-tuberculosis therapy [1–5]. Nowadays, about 95% of the estimated 8 million new TB cases occurring each year are in developing countries, where 80% occur among people between the ages of 15–59 years , although several strategies for TB control propagation are implemented. The reason of these fails might on the heterogeneity of the countries and difficulties to access to treatment in some places. In fact, heterogeneity plays an important role in many infectious disease processes. For instance, spatial heterogeneity is a strong determinant of host-parasite relationships. In modeling spatial or geographic effects on the spread of a disease, a distinction is usually made between diffusion and dispersal models. In diffusion models, spread is made to immediately adjacent zones, hence the phenomenon of traveling waves can appear. These models traditionally use partial differential equations (PDE). However, there are some important situations that cannot be modeled by PDE. This is the case when the space considered is discrete. For example, when sparsely populated regions have to be considered, the human population is located in patches. The organization of human-hosts into well-defined social units such as families, villages or cities, are good examples of patches. Another example arises in the study of the human African Trypanosomiasis. For situations where human can travel a long distance in a short period of time, dispersal models are more appropriate to capture heterogeneity. When considering dispersal models, there is an approach based on the metapopulation concept. The population is subdivided into a number of discrete patches which are supposed to be well mixed. Then in each patch, the population is subdivided into compartments corresponding to different epidemic status. This leads to a multi-compartment system. At this point two formulations are possible. The first one assumes that an infective in one patch can infect susceptible individuals in another patch. This assumption gives rise to a family of models which have been well studied [6–8]. The seminal model of  is the prototype of such systems. This formulation assumes that there is a spatial coupling between patches, but that individuals (vectors or hosts) do not migrate between patches. They make short ‘visits’ from their home patches to other patches. A number of theoretical studies have focused on the mathematical modelling of the spread of infectious diseases in heterogeneous complex metapopulations. Sattenspiel and Dietz  introduced a SIR epidemic model with population mobility. A two-patch model of trypanosomiasis is considered in  to explore control strategies through numerical simulations.

PMC7134536,2017-11-30,Non-linear Dynamics of Two-Patch Model Incorporating Secondary Dengue Infection,"In this paper, the impact of human migration on the dynamics of dengue epidemic has been discussed. The vector-host model considers two patches with different dengue serotype in each patch. The model considers the constant rate of migration in susceptible and recovered class from one patch to other. Recovered migrants from prior infection are exposed to secondary infection in the patch where different serotype is present. The basic reproduction number is computed and analyzed in terms of migration parameters. The model is analyzed for the existence and local stability of various equilibrium states in terms of migration parameters. The numerical simulations for the choice of relevant data from literature have been performed to verify analytical results and to further explore the dynamics of the system. The sensitivity analysis of basic reproduction number with respect to migration parameters is carried out. It is found that immigration in a patch increases the basic reproduction in respective patch and vice-versa. The basic reproduction number has been estimated for the two states of Brazil which verifies the occurrence of severe epidemic in one of the states of Brazil.","Dengue was confined to only nine countries before 1970. However, it has now been spread to more than 100 countries in the tropical, subtropical and temperate areas of North America, South America, Africa and Southeast Asia. According to one estimate, it affects 50–100 million people every year . In fact, World Health Organization has declared dengue as the fastest communicable mosquito-borne disease in the world in terms of human morbidity and mortality [2, 3]. The causes of emergence and resurgence of dengue disease are attributable to multiple factors including urbanization, fast transportation, economic development and changes in human behavior. The fast increase in modes of transportation, their reach, speed and efficiency led to the global movement of human population [2, 4]. This may be responsible for the spread of infectious diseases from isolated locations to the new regions. It has been reported that another 100 million people travel to dengue affected areas where they not only increase the risk of contracting the disease but also spreading it further afield. Dengue fever exhibits up to four closely related and distinct dengue viruses or serotypes. The origin of all four dengue serotypes is found to have in Asian forests and subsequently they have spread worldwide because of the migration of human and commerce . The mosquitoes Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus are the main carriers of these viruses. It is transmitted through infected mosquito bites. Once a person becomes infected by a serotype, he/she will never be reinfected by that serotype due to induced lifelong immunity against it. However, only temporal cross immunity is developed against the other serotypes . Therefore, the recovered individuals from a serotype may get secondary infection when exposed to a different serotype. Primary infections are generally asymptomatic and nonfatal, while secondary infections sometimes lead to the fatal forms of dengue infection, namely, dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) or dengue shock syndrome (DSS) [1, 7]. Mathematical modeling has been applied to understand and control the many vector-borne diseases like dengue, malaria, leishmaniasis, chagas diseases etc [8–13]. Some mathematical models on dengue dynamics incorporating primary and secondary infection have been proposed and analyzed by various investigators [11–16]."
PMC7134538,2018-08-25,Dynamics of an [Formula: see text] Epidemic Model with Vaccination and Saturated Incidence Rate,"Measles and influenza are two major diseases–caused an epidemic in India. Therefore, in this paper, a [Formula see text] epidemic mathematical model for measles and influenza is proposed and analyzed, where pre and post vaccinations are considered as control strategies with waning natural, vaccine-induced immunity and saturation incidence rate. The dissection of the proposed model is conferred in terms of the associated reproduction number [Formula see text] , which is determined by the next-generation approach and obtained that if [Formula see text] , the disease-free equilibrium exists and it is locally as well as globally asymptotically stable. Further for [Formula see text] , a unique endemic equilibrium exists and it is also locally as well as globally asymptotically stable under certain conditions, which shows the prevalence and persistence of the disease in the population.","Mathematical modeling has become an essential tool to analyze the spread and control of several infectious diseases [1, 2]. In recent years, many attempts have been made to develop some sensible mathematical models for investigating the dynamics and asymptotic behaviors [3–6]. Mathematical models take into account foremost factors that govern improvement of a disease, such as vaccination, transmission, recovery etc. The most important factor in the epidemic is asymptomatic or unapparent, where the infectious diseases spread incessantly throughout the population without showing symptoms. Individuals with asymptomatic infection are still infectious and supply to the dissemination of the disease from one human to a different [7, 8]. Asymptomatic diseases can decline the immune system and make individuals susceptible to other diseases. When a subclinical infection is not noticed by the infected individual, it is dangerous not only for infected individuals but also for other people around him. These infections are very risky for certain association of people such as pregnant women. The asymptomatic situation may not be identified until the patient undergoes medical tests (X-rays or other inquisition). Therefore, some people may remain asymptomatic for a remarkably long period of time and even they also died. This type of infection exists for many diseases, like measles, influenza etc. [5, 7]. Vaccines play a significant role in keeping us vigorous as they defend us from serious and sometimes fatal diseases, e.g., influenza and measles. There is a vast variability in the construction of vaccination models in epidemiology which entirely depends on the disease and the type of vaccines. Some vaccines may be greatly effective against infection while others may be unsuccessful in various respects like degree, duration, infectiousness, and progression etc . The most frequent vaccination plan is to immunize all individuals, where the spread of various infectious diseases can be prevented by giving vaccination at a regular rate to the susceptible population on pre or post level [10–12]. The pre-vaccination of susceptible may reduce the level of an epidemic, which was studied by the several researchers [9, 13, 14]. The cohort (or pre-vaccination) is considered in , where a proportion of newly recruited individuals are vaccinated. While the impact of post vaccination is studied by a number of researchers [15, 16], and obtained that, to eliminate the disease from the population, vaccination rate must be larger than the critical vaccination coverage otherwise the disease persists in the population. But only a few numbers of researchers studied both vaccination strategies simultaneously at the same time [17, 18]."
PMC7135310,2020-03-25,"Quantifying the roles of vomiting, diarrhea, and residents vs. staff in norovirus transmission in U.S. nursing home outbreaks","The role of individual case characteristics, such as symptoms or demographics, in norovirus transmissibility is poorly understood. Six nursing home norovirus outbreaks occurring in South Carolina, U.S. from 2014 to 2016 were examined. We aimed to quantify the contribution of symptoms and other case characteristics in norovirus transmission using the reproduction number (R(Ei)) as an estimate of individual case infectivity and to examine how transmission changes over the course of an outbreak. Individual estimates of R(Ei) were calculated using a maximum likelihood procedure to infer the average number of secondary cases generated by each case. The associations between case characteristics and R(Ei) were estimated using a weighted multivariate mixed linear model. Outbreaks began with one to three index case(s) with large estimated R(Ei)’s (range 1.48 to 8.70) relative to subsequent cases. Of the 209 cases, 155 (75%) vomited, 164 (79%) had diarrhea, and 158 (76%) were nursing home residents (vs. staff). Cases who vomited infected 2.12 (95% CI 1.68, 2.68) times the number of individuals as non-vomiters, cases with diarrhea infected 1.39 (95% CI 1.03, 1.87) times the number of individuals as cases without diarrhea, and resident-cases infected 1.53 (95% CI 1.15, 2.02) times the number of individuals as staff-cases. Index cases tended to be residents (vs. staff) who vomited and infected considerably more secondary cases compared to non-index cases. Results suggest that individuals, particularly residents, who vomit are more infectious and tend to drive norovirus transmission in U.S. nursing home norovirus outbreaks. While diarrhea also plays a role in norovirus transmission, it is to a lesser degree than vomiting in these settings. Results lend support for prevention and control measures that focus on cases who vomit, particularly if those cases are residents.","There are 49.2 million individuals over 65 in the U.S. population (15.2%) and this population is growing . With nearly half of this age group spending some part of their lives in nursing homes , the number of older adults using paid long-term care services is expected to grow substantially over the coming decade . In the U.S. and other high-income countries, gastroenteritis outbreaks are common in nursing homes, skilled nursing facilities and assisted living facilities, which are collectively known as long-term care facilities (LTCFs) [4–7]. Despite the perception that norovirus is a foodborne disease or the ‘cruise ship virus’, the majority of all norovirus outbreaks reported to the CDC occur in LTCFs . While norovirus gastroenteritis is generally mild and self-limiting, older nursing home residents are vulnerable to infection leading to hospitalization and death , with the vast majority of norovirus-associated deaths in the U.S. occurring among persons aged 65 years and older . Norovirus is highly transmissible in nursing homes [10–12], but there is no vaccine or specific antiviral therapy available to prevent or treat norovirus infection. As a result, rapid implementation of standard control measures is the mainstay for curtailing transmission . Identifying factors associated with norovirus transmission is critical to better understanding disease spread and preventing additional cases. Individual-level risk factors for susceptibility to norovirus infection or severe disease in nursing home outbreaks have been identified, including resident mobility, dependency on staff assistance , immunodeficiency , and statin use . But because transmission of norovirus from one person to another cannot be directly observed (unlike symptoms and/or positive test results that follow transmission), it remains poorly understood and the evidence base for the value of specific prevention and control measures is lacking ."
PMC7158152,2020-04-15,Forecasting the 2017/2018 seasonal influenza epidemic in England using multiple dynamic transmission models: a case study," Since the 2009 A/H1N1 pandemic, Public Health England have developed a suite of real-time statistical models utilising enhanced pandemic surveillance data to nowcast and forecast a future pandemic. Their ability to track seasonal influenza and predict heightened winter healthcare burden in the light of high activity in Australia in 2017 was untested. METHODS Four transmission models were used in forecasting the 2017/2018 seasonal influenza epidemic in England a stratified primary care model using daily, region-specific, counts and virological swab positivity of influenza-like illness consultations in general practice (GP); a strain-specific (SS) model using weekly, national GP ILI and virological data; an intensive care model (ICU) using reports of ICU influenza admissions; and a synthesis model that included all data sources. For the first 12 weeks of 2018, each model was applied to the latest data to provide estimates of epidemic parameters and short-term influenza forecasts. The added value of pre-season population susceptibility data was explored. RESULTS The combined results provided valuable nowcasts of the state of the epidemic. Short-term predictions of burden on primary and secondary health services were initially highly variable before reaching consensus beyond the observed peaks in activity between weeks 3–4 of 2018. Estimates for R were consistent over time for three of the four models until week 12 of 2018, and there was consistency in the estimation of R across the SPC and SS models, and in the ICU attack rates estimated by the ICU and the synthesis model. Estimation and predictions varied according to the assumed levels of pre-season immunity. CONCLUSIONS This exercise successfully applied a range of pandemic models to seasonal influenza. Forecasting early in the season remains challenging but represents a crucially important activity to inform planning. Improved knowledge of pre-existing levels of immunity would be valuable.","The evolution of influenza viruses results in annual epidemics of seasonal influenza, with less frequent global pandemics occurring due to the emergence of novel influenza viruses to which there is little population immunity. Both have the potential to cause substantial burden of disease to the population and to present significant challenges to already strained healthcare systems [1–3]. Many countries have invested substantial resources to developing epidemiological and virological surveillance tools to rapidly detect the onset of the influenza season each year [4, 5]; to measure the level of activity and the impact on the health service; and to characterise the main circulating virus strains and how well they match the seasonal vaccine. Attempts, however, to undertake seasonal influenza forecasting have been historically challenging due to the complex interplay between the influenza virus, population immunity, and environmental factors . Nonetheless, progress has been made in the provision of short-term predictions of influenza in some countries in recent years particularly in the United States [5, 7], encouraging similar endeavours elsewhere. In the UK, the National Risk Register of Civil Emergencies lists an outbreak of pandemic influenza as the greatest risk faced by its population . Before, during and after 2009 A/H1N1pdm, quantitative approaches for real-time modelling and forecasting burden have been developed [9–11]. The availability of these models, together with complementary surveillance and data collection systems including sero-epidemiology for seasonal influenza, provided the opportunity to address the challenge of predicting seasonal influenza activity in England. This became a pressing need, when, following a particularly intense 2017 influenza season in Australia , prior to the winter season 2017/8 the National Health Service (NHS) put in place winter preparedness plans to manage potential acute pressures on the health service . Ultimately, England experienced the most intense influenza season since the first post-pandemic season in 2010/11 . Questions were raised about how the epidemic would evolve, when it would peak, how intense the peak in activity would be, and what would be the resulting demands on the health service, in terms of burden on GPs, hospitals, and intensive care units."
PMC7169241,2010-05-20,The Effect of Mask Use on the Spread of Influenza During a Pandemic,"Face masks have traditionally been used in general infection control, but their efficacy at the population level in preventing transmission of influenza viruses has not been studied in detail. Data from published clinical studies indicate that the infectivity of influenza A virus is probably very high, so that transmission of infection may involve low doses of virus. At low doses, the relation between dose and the probability of infection is approximately linear, so that the reduction in infection risk is proportional to the reduction in exposure due to particle retention of the mask. A population transmission model was set up to explore the impact of population‐wide mask use, allowing estimation of the effects of mask efficacy and coverage (fraction of the population wearing masks) on the basic reproduction number and the infection attack rate. We conclude that population‐wide use of face masks could make an important contribution in delaying an influenza pandemic. Mask use also reduces the reproduction number, possibly even to levels sufficient for containing an influenza outbreak.","Pandemic preparedness involves implementation of both pharmaceutical (vaccination and antiviral drugs) and nonpharmaceutical countermeasures. As adequate pharmaceutical supplies will not be available immediately and may be insufficient for the total population, the WHO working group for public health interventions recommends nonpharmaceutical interventions as an important additional control measure. Such measures fall into four groups, aiming to  limit international spread of the virus;  reduce spread within populations;  reduce the individual risk of infection (through personal protection and hygiene measures); and  raise public awareness of the risks.
 Masks have traditionally been used for centuries, for example, during the 17th‐century plagues, the 1918 influenza pandemic and, more recently, the SARS epidemic in 2003. Retrospective case‐control studies showed that mask use by the general public may have offered significant protection against SARS.(5

PMC7217494,2016-03-11,Role of structural holes in containing spreading processes,"Structural holes are channels or paths spanned by a group of indirectly connected nodes and their intermediary in a network. In this work we emphasize the interesting role of structural holes as brokers for information propagation. Based on the distribution of the structural hole numbers associated with each node, we propose a simple yet effective approach for choosing the most influential nodes to immunize in containing the spreading processes. Using a wide spectrum of large real-world networks, we demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms conventional methods in a remarkable way. In particular, we find that the performance gains of our approach are particularly prominent for networks with high transitivity and assortativity, which verifies the vital role of structural holes in information diffusion on networked systems.","Networks have emerged as an attractive theme in complex system research, due to their universality for depicting a variety of natural and synthetic systems [1,2]. Based on the fact that a complex system consists of many mutually interacting components, the interaction among components and how they intertwine can be captured by a graph, where nodes correspond to individual components and edges to their interactions. Such a network can be thought of as a backbone of the complex system along which signals, information, and contagious entities propagate. In real-world networks, however, undesirable signals can also spread through networks. For example, malicious rumors can spread among individuals, computer worms deluge the internet, and epidemic diseases can infect vulnerable people through contact. Hence, developing effective strategies for preventing the spreading of harmful signals through a network is a research challenge of both theoretical and practical importance. In general, containing spreading processes, a dual problem to the influence maximization problem (i.e., finding the most influential nodes for information diffusion), can be formulated as an optimization problem that is non-deterministic polynomial-time hard. Therefore, pursuing an exact solution to influence minimization for large-scale networks suffers from combinatorial explosion. Alternatively, a number of efficient approaches are proposed to approximately solve the problem [3–10]. These solutions can be classified into two categories (i) optimization-based methods; for example, by using the greedy heuristic climbing algorithm, the result of Kempe et al.  shows that it can approximate the optimum to within a factor of 1−1/e (where e is the base of the natural logarithm); and (ii) structure-based approaches, typically inspired by the relatedness between the topology and functionality of networks, such as those topology based heuristic methods including [4,5]. Compared with the optimization-based algorithms, heuristics approaches are computationally much more efficient and thus more practical in a diversity of networked systems. Therefore, it is of particular interest to devise efficient methods by leveraging the information of the structures of complex networks."
PMC7217497,2020-01-09,Traffic-driven epidemic spreading in multiplex networks,"Recent progress on multiplex networks has provided a powerful way to abstract the diverse interaction of a network system with multiple layers. In this paper, we show that a multiplex structure can greatly affect the spread of an epidemic driven by traffic dynamics. One of the interesting findings is that the multiplex structure could suppress the outbreak of an epidemic, which is different from the typical finding of spread dynamics in multiplex networks. In particular, one layer with dense connections can attract more traffic flow and eventually suppress the epidemic outbreak in other layers. Therefore, the epidemic threshold will be larger than the minimal threshold of the layers. With a mean-field approximation, we provide explicit expressions for the epidemic threshold and for the onset of suppressing epidemic spreading in multiplex networks. We also provide the probability of obtaining a multiplex configuration that suppresses the epidemic spreading when the multiplex is composed of (i) two Erdős-Rényi layers and (ii) two scale-free layers. Therefore, compared to the situation of an isolated network in which a disease may be able to propagate, a larger epidemic threshold can be found in multiplex structures.","Complex networks have become an efficient abstraction of the interactions between individuals in real complex systems. The theory of complex networks has led to many interesting results in various areas of interdisciplinary science . Recently, the study of multiplex networks has become the new frontier in the area of complex networks . Multiplex networks are proved to describe many real-life systems better, especially when these systems are composed of different but interconnected subnetworks [2–5]. Representative examples include the traffic systems with multimodal transportation, and the social networks where individuals can use multiple platforms. In social networks, an individual can use different platforms to communicate with different categories of friends kinship, vicinity, membership of the same society, colleague in a company, etc. In the spreading of information, people will first select the subgroup of friends that are thought to be interested and then forward the information to the subgroup. Multimodal traffic systems can be also abstracted as traffic dynamics on top of a multiplex structure. In the system, each geographical location has different entry points for different transportation media. Traffic dynamics are usually modeled as the flow of elements from origin to destination nodes guided by routing paths [6,7]. The routing strategy and network structure can greatly influence the emergence of congestion [8–13]. Many works have been devoted to extend the traffic and spreading dynamics on isolated networks to multiplex networks [14–20]. The multiplex structure has been proved to affect the transportation process, such as traffic load distribution, and choice of origin and destination [15,21–23]. For example, in the multimodal traffic system, each element can choose the most appropriate media to start and end its travel. If all elements adopt the shortest paths to minimize their travel distance, this “selfish behavior” will provoke an unbalance in the traffic load of the transportation layers and induce counterintuitive congestion [15,23]."
PMC7217501,2019-09-24,Epidemic spreading with awareness and different timescales in multiplex networks,"One of the major issues in theoretical modeling of epidemic spreading is the development of methods to control the transmission of an infectious agent. Human behavior plays a fundamental role in the spreading dynamics and can be used to stop a disease from spreading or to reduce its burden, as individuals aware of the presence of a disease can take measures to reduce their exposure to contagion. In this paper, we propose a mathematical model for the spread of diseases with awareness in complex networks. Unlike previous models, the information is propagated following a generalized Maki-Thompson rumor model. Flexibility on the timescale between information and disease spreading is also included. We verify that the velocity characterizing the diffusion of information awareness greatly influences the disease prevalence. We also show that a reduction in the fraction of unaware individuals does not always imply a decrease of the prevalence, as the relative timescale between disease and awareness spreading plays a crucial role in the systems' dynamics. This result is shown to be independent of the network topology. We finally calculate the epidemic threshold of our model, and show that it does not depend on the relative timescale. Our results provide a new view on how information influence disease spreading and can be used for the development of more efficient methods for disease control.","Mathematical and computational studies of epidemic models have proven to be very important for understanding real-world disease dynamics [1,2]. Currently, one of the main motivations behind epidemic modeling is the development of methods and models that allow to control the transmission of an infectious agent [1,3]. These methods include the optimization of more traditional strategies to control an outbreak, such as vaccination [3,4] or or a quarantine mechanism based on adaptive connections [5,6], but also novel approaches that take into account more accurately human behavioral responses. Modeling the influence of human behavior in disease spreading is an intense research topic [7–11]. In particular, individual prevention methods can considerably reduce the overall incidence of a disease, but the acknowledgment of the methods and the decision to adopt them depend on behavioral factors. The latter have been modeled using opinion dynamics [12–15], game-theoretical approaches[16–19], spreading processes [20–25], risk perception [26–30], and other approaches ."
PMC7217507,2017-07-05,Discrete-time dynamic network model for the spread of susceptible-infective-recovered diseases,"We propose a discrete-time dynamic network model describing the spread of susceptible-infective-recovered diseases in a population. We consider the case in which the nodes in the network change their links due to social mixing dynamics as well as in response to the disease. The model shows the behavior that, as we increase social mixing, disease spread is inhibited in certain cases, while in other cases it is enhanced. We also extend this dynamic network model to take into account the case of hidden infection. Here we find that, as expected, the disease spreads more readily if there is a time period after contracting the disease during which an individual is infective but is not known to have the disease.","The importance of the contact pattern of individuals in epidemic spreading has long been acknowledged by researchers [1–4]. With the growth of the field of complex networks, there have been a number of studies on infection spreading on networks with nontrivial properties [5–11]. Typically, the underlying network in epidemic-spreading models is considered to be static. One can then study the effect of network structure on disease propagation. While the assumption of a static network may work well for cases in which the topology of the network does not change significantly during the course of the spreading process, in general we cannot neglect the fact that human contacts evolve over time. Depending on the disease and the type of contacts in which we are interested, the time scales for the change of human contacts and the spread of an epidemic may vary. To take into account the changing contacts of individuals, many researchers have considered disease spread on networks in which links change over time [12–15]. In the epidemiological literature, dynamic models where contacts are constantly being formed and dissolved have been considered. Using models based on partnership formation [16–18], one can study the effect of dynamic contacts due to mixing. These models do not take into account the contact networks behind partnership formation and assume that contacts form at random. Thus, attempts have also been made to consider the underlying network structure in disease propagation models. For example, Volz and Meyers  considered a susceptible-infective-recovered (SIR) model on a full network in which each individual's contacts change in time. In their model, referred to as the neighbor exchange model, the dynamics of partnership is implemented through edge swapping between two already connected pairs of nodes."
PMC7217508,2016-11-28,Epidemic spreading in random rectangular networks,The use of network theory to model disease propagation on populations introduces important elements of reality to the classical epidemiological models. The use of random geometric graphs (RGGs) is one of such network models that allows for the consideration of spatial properties on disease propagation. In certain real-world scenarios—like in the analysis of a disease propagating through plants—the shape of the plots and fields where the host of the disease is located may play a fundamental role in the propagation dynamics. Here we consider a generalization of the RGG to account for the variation of the shape of the plots or fields where the hosts of a disease are allocated. We consider a disease propagation taking place on the nodes of a random rectangular graph and we consider a lower bound for the epidemic threshold of a susceptible-infected-susceptible model or a susceptible-infected-recovered model on these networks. Using extensive numerical simulations and based on our analytical results we conclude that (ceteris paribus) the elongation of the plot or field in which the nodes are distributed makes the network more resilient to the propagation of a disease due to the fact that the epidemic threshold increases with the elongation of the rectangle. These results agree with accumulated empirical evidence and simulation results about the propagation of diseases on plants in plots or fields of the same area and different shapes.,"The study of epidemiological models on networks is one of the areas that has observed a major development in the application of network theory to real-world problems . The discovery of the fact that networks with fat-tailed degree distributions do not display an epidemic threshold in the asymptotic limit is a relevant example of how the connectivity pattern of interacting agents can dramatically change the course of an epidemic [2,3]. The use of network theory in epidemiological models provides a way to incorporate the individual-level heterogeneity necessary for the mechanistic understanding of the spread of infectious disease. These characteristics are very attractive for the application of network epidemiological models in ecology on the different spatial and temporal scales. Although there have been many successful applications of network theory to human and animal epidemiology, the situation is a little less developed for epidemics on plants. Ten years ago Jeger et al.  recognized the relatively low use of network theory for studying plant diseases. Since then, more theoretical developments have been presented in the literature. These models include the important description of the geometric constraints in which the pathogen is spreading as well as stochasticity and several sources of heterogeneity in the transmission of infection [5–8]."
PMC7217509,2017-01-03,Influence of trust in the spreading of information,"The understanding and prediction of information diffusion processes on networks is a major challenge in network theory with many implications in social sciences. Many theoretical advances occurred due to stochastic spreading models. Nevertheless, these stochastic models overlooked the influence of rational decisions on the outcome of the process. For instance, different levels of trust in acquaintances do play a role in information spreading, and actors may change their spreading decisions during the information diffusion process accordingly. Here, we study an information-spreading model in which the decision to transmit or not is based on trust. We explore the interplay between the propagation of information and the trust dynamics happening on a two-layer multiplex network. Actors' trustable or untrustable states are defined as accumulated cooperation or defection behaviors, respectively, in a Prisoner's Dilemma setup, and they are controlled by a memory span. The propagation of information is abstracted as a threshold model on the information-spreading layer, where the threshold depends on the trustability of agents. The analysis of the model is performed using a tree approximation and validated on homogeneous and heterogeneous networks. The results show that the memory of previous actions has a significant effect on the spreading of information. For example, the less memory that is considered, the higher is the diffusion. Information is highly promoted by the emergence of trustable acquaintances. These results provide insight into the effect of plausible biases on spreading dynamics in a multilevel networked system.","Epidemics, innovation, rumors, gossip, and opinions spread on social networks [1–19]. With the availability of large-scale data on social networks, the study of modeling information, rumor and gossip diffusion has recently attracted a great deal of attention [14–18,20–23]. A fundamental step toward understanding information diffusion was the adoption of threshold and cascade models [24–26] applied to spreading in social networks. In this last context, an actor's diffusion behavior depends on the number of other individuals already engaged in the process [5,27,28]. These works have recently been generalized to multilevel networks [29–32]. The diffusion of information has also been modeled using game theory, giving players a positive payoff if they spread the information [8,23,33,34]. Moreover, the topological factors that may affect the spreading have been investigated in detail in [27,35,36]. Other applications related to information diffusion, such as finding the influential spreaders , maximizing or restraining the information propagation [38,39], predicting the information diffusion on real-world social networks [10,40–42], and revealing general patterns of the diffusion of the temporal information , have also been studied extensively."
PMC7217520,2018-01-31,Effect of risk perception on epidemic spreading in temporal networks,"Many progresses in the understanding of epidemic spreading models have been obtained thanks to numerous modeling efforts and analytical and numerical studies, considering host populations with very different structures and properties, including complex and temporal interaction networks. Moreover, a number of recent studies have started to go beyond the assumption of an absence of coupling between the spread of a disease and the structure of the contacts on which it unfolds. Models including awareness of the spread have been proposed, to mimic possible precautionary measures taken by individuals that decrease their risk of infection, but have mostly considered static networks. Here, we adapt such a framework to the more realistic case of temporal networks of interactions between individuals. We study the resulting model by analytical and numerical means on both simple models of temporal networks and empirical time-resolved contact data. Analytical results show that the epidemic threshold is not affected by the awareness but that the prevalence can be significantly decreased. Numerical studies on synthetic temporal networks highlight, however, the presence of very strong finite-size effects, resulting in a significant shift of the effective epidemic threshold in the presence of risk awareness. For empirical contact networks, the awareness mechanism leads as well to a shift in the effective threshold and to a strong reduction of the epidemic prevalence.","The propagation patterns of an infectious disease depend on many factors, including the number and properties of the different stages of the disease, the transmission and recovery mechanisms and rates, and the hosts' behavior (e.g., their contacts and mobility) [1,2]. Given the inherent complexity of a microscopic description taking into account all details, simple models are typically used as basic mathematical frameworks aiming at capturing the main characteristics of the epidemic spreading process and in particular at understanding if and how strategies such as quarantine or immunization can help contain it. Such models have been developed with increasing levels of sophistication and detail in the description of both the disease evolution and the behavior of the host population [1,2]. Obviously, the diffusion of the disease in the host population depends crucially on the patterns of contacts between hosts. The simplest homogeneous mixing assumption, which makes many analytical results achievable, considers that individuals are identical and that each has a uniform probability of being in contact with any other individual [1,2]. Even within this crude approximation, it is possible to highlight fundamental aspects of epidemic spreading, such as the epidemic threshold, signaling a nonequilibrium phase transition that separates an epidemic-free phase from a phase in which a finite fraction of the population is affected . However, this approach neglects any nontrivial structure of the contacts, while advances in network science  have shown that many networks of interest have in common important features such as a strong heterogeneity in the number of connections, a large number of triads, community structures, and a low average shortest path length between individuals [3,4]. Spreading models have thus been adapted to complex networks, unveiling the important role of these properties [5–7]. More recently, a number of studies have also considered spreading processes on time-varying networks [8–13], to take into account the fact that contact networks evolve on various timescales and present nontrivial temporal properties such as broad distribution of contact durations [14,15] and burstiness [8,16] (i.e., the timeline of social interactions of a given individual exhibits periods of time with intense activity separated by long quiescent periods with no interactions)."
PMC7217521,2017-08-31,Accurate ranking of influential spreaders in networks based on dynamically asymmetric link weights,"We propose an efficient and accurate measure for ranking spreaders and identifying the influential ones in spreading processes in networks. While the edges determine the connections among the nodes, their specific role in spreading should be considered explicitly. An edge connecting nodes [Formula see text] and [Formula see text] may differ in its importance for spreading from [Formula see text] to [Formula see text] and from [Formula see text] to [Formula see text]. The key issue is whether node [Formula see text] , after infected by [Formula see text] through the edge, would reach out to other nodes that [Formula see text] itself could not reach directly. It becomes necessary to invoke two unequal weights [Formula see text] and [Formula see text] characterizing the importance of an edge according to the neighborhoods of nodes [Formula see text] and [Formula see text]. The total asymmetric directional weights originating from a node leads to a novel measure [Formula see text] , which quantifies the impact of the node in spreading processes. An [Formula see text]-shell decomposition scheme further assigns an [Formula see text]-shell index or weighted coreness to the nodes. The effectiveness and accuracy of rankings based on [Formula see text] and the weighted coreness are demonstrated by applying them to nine real-world networks. Results show that they generally outperform rankings based on the nodes' degree and [Formula see text]-shell index while maintaining a low computational complexity. Our work represents a crucial step towards understanding and controlling the spread of diseases, rumors, information, trends, and innovations in networks.","The structural properties of complex networks and the intricate interplay between the structure and spreading dynamics lead to highly diversified spreading capabilities among individual nodes. From the perspective of the severity of a spreading process, the most influential spreaders are those resulting in a much larger final infected proportion of the whole system when the spread of a disease or a piece of information originates from them than from other nodes. Centrality measures such as the degree , betweenness , closeness , eigenvector centrality , and k-shell coreness  have been used to identify the most influential spreaders. The degree is the simplest measure. In social networks, for example, an individual with a large degree has more direct contact with other people and is thus likely to be more influential than one with a small degree for transmitting disease or information. Subsequent research indicates that the core nodes as identified by the k-shell decomposition are the most influential spreaders . Algorithms based on other centrality measures have been proposed to improve the accuracy of identifying influential spreaders [7–10]. They include the neighborhood coreness , improved eigenvector centrality [12,13], H index [14,15], and nonbacktracking centrality . Methods other than centrality-based algorithms have also been proposed for predicting how influential a node can be in a spread. For example, by counting the number of possible infection paths of various lengths, the final infection range can be estimated for a spread originated from any node . The degree distribution of clusters of infected nodes after certain transmission events leads to a node property called the expected force, which can be applied to predict the spreading influence of all nodes under different epidemiological models . The dynamic-sensitive centrality is able to locate influential nodes from both topological features and the dynamical parameters, such as the infection and recovery rates in a susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR) spreading model . In the k-truss decomposition, which is a triangle-based extension of k-shell decomposition, the maximal k-truss subgraph contains the most influential spreaders ."
PMC7217522,2017-01-18,Fundamental difference between superblockers and superspreaders in networks,"Two important problems regarding spreading phenomena in complex topologies are the optimal selection of node sets either to minimize or maximize the extent of outbreaks. Both problems are nontrivial when a small fraction of the nodes in the network can be used to achieve the desired goal. The minimization problem is equivalent to a structural optimization. The “superblockers,” i.e., the nodes that should be removed from the network to minimize the size of outbreaks, are those nodes that make connected components as small as possible. “Superspreaders” are instead the nodes such that, if chosen as initiators, they maximize the average size of outbreaks. The identity of superspreaders is expected to depend not just on the topology, but also on the specific dynamics considered. Recently, it has been conjectured that the two optimization problems might be equivalent, in the sense that superblockers act also as superspreaders. In spite of its potential groundbreaking importance, no empirical study has been performed to validate this conjecture. In this paper, we perform an extensive analysis over a large set of real-world networks to test the similarity between sets of superblockers and of superspreaders. We show that the two optimization problems are not equivalent superblockers do not act as optimal spreaders.","The interplay between structure and function is at the heart of the interest attracted by the study of complex networks in recent years. Processes mediated by disordered interaction patterns are affected by the topological properties of the underlying graph in nontrivial ways [1–3]. Spreading phenomena are among the most fundamental and studied types of dynamics occurring on networks . In this context, a natural question, with implications for practical applications, is the following given a network and a spreading dynamics on top of it, how can we identify the set of n “superspreaders,” i.e., the n vertices such that, if the spreading process is initiated simultaneously by all of them, the average number of nodes reached by the spreading event is maximal? This problem is often indicated also as “influence maximization,” in particular in computer science, where fundamental results have been derived [5,6]. An equally interesting and important problem is the identification of the set of n “superblockers,” i.e., the n vertices such that, if immunized, and thus effectively removed from the network, lead to the minimal average size of the outbreak. As spreading may occur only if contacts are present, the identification of superblockers is equivalent to the solution of the so-called optimal percolation problem , i.e., the identification of the minimum set of nodes to be eliminated in order to destroy the giant component of the network. Superblockers effectively correspond to the nodes that, when removed, minimize the size of the largest connected component in the network. Solving the optimal percolation problem is nontrivial, and many interesting results have appeared in the past few months [8–11]."
PMC7217525,2017-10-26,Epidemic spreading on activity-driven networks with attractiveness,"We study SIS epidemic spreading processes unfolding on a recent generalization of the activity-driven modeling framework. In this model of time-varying networks, each node is described by two variables activity and attractiveness. The first describes the propensity to form connections, while the second defines the propensity to attract them. We derive analytically the epidemic threshold considering the time scale driving the evolution of contacts and the contagion as comparable. The solutions are general and hold for any joint distribution of activity and attractiveness. The theoretical picture is confirmed via large-scale numerical simulations performed considering heterogeneous distributions and different correlations between the two variables. We find that heterogeneous distributions of attractiveness alter the contagion process. In particular, in the case of uncorrelated and positive correlations between the two variables, heterogeneous attractiveness facilitates the spreading. On the contrary, negative correlations between activity and attractiveness hamper the spreading. The results presented contribute to the understanding of the dynamical properties of time-varying networks and their effects on contagion phenomena unfolding on their fabric.","Many social, natural, and technological systems can be modeled as networks. The structure of such systems is often not fixed and exhibits complex temporal dynamics [1–4]. However, the large majority of studies revolve around representations that neglect the role of time [5–7]. In particular, connections are typically approximated as either static or annealed [8,9]. Since networks are often used as an environment for the study of dynamical processes, the choice concerning which approximation to adopt is a matter of time scales when the process is faster than the network evolution, the network structure can be assumed static; in the opposite conditions, networks can be effectively described by annealed representations. However, when the time scale of the process studied is comparable to the one characterizing the network evolution, static or annealed approximations are not viable and can lead to incorrect conclusions such as misrepresenting (i) the spreading potential of a disease [8,10–28], (ii) the exploring capabilities of random walkers [29–33], (iii) the features of social interactions [34–47], or the processes of (iv) information spreading [48–52], (v) synchronization , (vi) percolation , (vii) consensus , (viii) competition , (ix) social contagion , and (x) innovation . Thanks to the unprecedented availability of large and longitudinal datasets, in recent years a great effort has been put into the development of temporal network representations and models. See Refs. [1–3] for detailed reviews on the subject."
PMC7217539,2019-02-25,Role of hubs in the synergistic spread of behavior,"The spread of behavior in a society has two major features the synergy of multiple spreaders and the dominance of hubs. While strong synergy is known to induce mixed-order transitions (MOTs) at percolation, the effects of hubs on the phenomena are yet to be clarified. By analytically solving the generalized epidemic process on random scale-free networks with the power-law degree distribution [Formula see text] , we clarify how the dominance of hubs in social networks affects the conditions for MOTs. Our results show that, for [Formula see text] , an abundance of hubs drive MOTs, even if a synergistic spreading event requires an arbitrarily large number of adjacent spreaders. In particular, for [Formula see text] , we find that a global cascade is possible even when only synergistic spreading events are allowed. These transition properties are substantially different from those of cooperative contagions, which are another class of synergistic cascading processes exhibiting MOTs.",". There has been a growing body of literature on mixed-order transitions (MOTs), which qualify as both continuous and discontinuous phase transitions depending on the chosen order parameter. Such transitions appear in many different contexts, such as DNA unzipping [1–3], Ising spins with long-range interactions , and various percolation models with biased merger of clusters . A common aspect of these systems is the existence of long-range interactions which encourage global ordering over a finite fraction of the system at criticality . Recently added to the list are various models of cascades with synergistic spreading rules involving cooperation between different contagions [6–9], weakened individuals [10–16], or multiple spreading thresholds . If each transmission occurs independently without synergy, the cascade exhibits a continuous percolation transition . In contrast, with sufficiently strong synergy, the transition can be a MOT a continuous transition of the probability of a global cascade coincides with a discontinuous jump of the cascade size. Moreover, the lines of MOTs and purely continuous transitions join at a tricritical point (TCP) with its own critical properties . Again, the long loops of the substrate, through which different spreading pathways cross each other, facilitate global cascades at the MOTs [8,11]."
PMC7217543,2017-01-17,Effective distances for epidemics spreading on complex networks,We show that the recently introduced logarithmic metrics used to predict disease arrival times on complex networks are approximations of more general network-based measures derived from random walks theory. Using the daily air-traffic transportation data we perform numerical experiments to compare the infection arrival time with this alternative metric that is obtained by accounting for multiple walks instead of only the most probable path. The comparison with direct simulations reveals a higher correlation compared to the shortest-path approach used previously. In addition our method allows to connect fundamental observables in epidemic spreading with the cumulant-generating function of the hitting time for a Markov chain. Our results provides a general and computationally efficient approach using only algebraic methods.,"Networks have received growing attention in the past decade particularly due to their applicability in describing a wide range of phenomena. Prominent examples are the mapping of the World Wide Web and structure of the Internet, social and financial networks, epidemiology, and language dynamics [1–4]. In the context of epidemic spreading the prediction of outbreaks has become particularly important for public health issues. The rapid growth in the velocity of transportation means and frequency of movements has further increased the risk that global emergent diseases such as H1N1 , SARS , or EBOV , and more recently ZIKV , will spread worldwide. The underlying mobility networks are usually scale-free . This implies the absence of an epidemic threshold  that allows any transmittable disease to spread through the global population. The large amount of traffic data both at the local and global scale, which became available in recent years, provides a new opportunity to understand such processes. On the one hand numerical simulations of infection spreading offer a practical tool for estimating the infection arrival time . In this regard metapopulation models [12–14] provide a reasonable tool for maintaining a high level of complexity in the simulation of pandemics . At the global scale the different subpopulations, defined by the nodes of the network, are cities that can be connected by directed or undirected fluxes of individuals, provided by the worldwide transportation network data. On the other hand algebraic methods give a solid foundation for drawing general conclusions and in many cases provide numerical instruments superior to direct simulations."
PMC7217551,2019-03-29,Understanding the temporal pattern of spreading in heterogeneous networks: Theory of the mean infection time,"For a reliable prediction of an epidemic or information spreading pattern in complex systems, well-defined measures are essential. In the susceptible-infected model on heterogeneous networks, the cluster of infected nodes in the intermediate-time regime exhibits too large fluctuation in size to use its mean size as a representative value. The cluster size follows quite a broad distribution, which is shown to be derived from the variation of the cluster size with the time when a hub node was first infected. On the contrary, the distribution of the time taken to infect a given number of nodes is well concentrated at its mean, suggesting the mean infection time is a better measure. We show that the mean infection time can be evaluated by using the scaling behaviors of the boundary area of the infected cluster and use it to find a nonexponential but algebraic spreading phase in the intermediate stage on strongly heterogeneous networks. Such slow spreading originates in only small-degree nodes left susceptible, while most hub nodes are already infected in the early exponential-spreading stage. Our results offer a way to detour around large statistical fluctuations and quantify reliably the temporal pattern of spread under structural heterogeneity.","Heterogeneity of the connectivity of elements in complex systems  leads to peculiar dynamic behaviors, including large connected components formed with a small number of links , the onset of a global epidemic  or synchronization  at all positive interaction strengths, and a novel singularity of the free energy in the Ising and the Potts models [5–7]. Different dynamic influences of nodes essentially determined by their degrees (numbers of connected nodes) have been shown to underlie such anomalous emergent behaviors by extensive studies on the structure and dynamics of complex networks [8–10]. This advancement in our understanding is, however, restricted to the equilibrium or stationary state. In reality, taking quick action before reaching the stationary state is necessary to control, e.g., the spread of a life-threatening virus or the word about marketed products. Despite such importance, theoretical understanding of the nonstationary state is far from complete. This is partly because of the time variation of relevant variables and having neither small nor large order parameters in the intermediate-time regime, defying analytic approaches based on approximations which are valid in the early- or late-time regime. Moreover, the speed of epidemic spreading shows a large statistical fluctuation, presumably due to the heterogeneity of the infection seed's degree and the stochasticity of infection trajectories [11,12]. As we will address here, the epidemic size at a given time suffers from such a large fluctuation that it is disqualified from being a reliable measure, particularly in the intermediate stage of spreading. Therefore, a new reliable measure and its theory are required to predict and control efficiently disease and information spreading in real-world complex systems."
PMC7222150,2020-05-10,Coupling the Macroscale to the Microscale in a Spatiotemporal Context to Examine Effects of Spatial Diffusion on Disease Transmission,"There are many challenges to coupling the macroscale to the microscale in temporal or spatial contexts. In order to examine effects of an individual movement and spatial control measures on a disease outbreak, we developed a multiscale model and extended the semi-stochastic simulation method by linking individual movements to pathogen’s diffusion, linking the slow dynamics for disease transmission at the population level to the fast dynamics for pathogen shedding/excretion at the individual level. Numerical simulations indicate that during a disease outbreak individuals with the same infection status show the property of clustering and, in particular, individuals’ rapid movements lead to an increase in the average reproduction number [Formula see text] , the final size and the peak value of the outbreak. It is interesting that a high level of aggregation the individuals’ movement results in low new infections and a small final size of the infected population. Further, we obtained that either high diffusion rate of the pathogen or frequent environmental clearance lead to a decline in the total number of infected individuals, indicating the need for control measures such as improving air circulation or environmental hygiene. We found that the level of spatial heterogeneity when implementing control greatly affects the control efficacy, and in particular, an uniform isolation strategy leads to low a final size and small peak, compared with local measures, indicating that a large-scale isolation strategy with frequent clearance of the environment is beneficial for disease control.","The transmission of infectious diseases exhibits spatiotemporal multiple-scale properties, including transmission dynamics at the population level, with viral replication and interaction with targeted cells at the individual level. Moreover, between-host disease transmission is generally dependent on the within-host viral loads, and vice versa. Also, different enteroviral serotypes greatly influence the between-host transmission. A number of mathematical models of infectious diseases have been studied extensively by employing single-scale-based models at the immunological or epidemiological scales (Anderson and May 1991; Nowak and May 2000; Diekmnann and Heesterbeek 2000). The immunological models focus on the within-host immune viral dynamics at the individual level, while the epidemiological models focus on the between-host transmission dynamics at the population level. Availability of big data at various levels and emergence of unanswered questions enable novel methods of mathematical models to connect within-host immune viral dynamics with the between-host epidemiological transmission of infectious diseases.
 A multiscale immuno-epidemiological modeling approach has become an emerging method to study the synergistic dynamics of pathogens/viruses at the individual and population levels (Gog et al. 2015; Shen et al. 2015; Sun et al. 2016; Hosseini and Gabhann 2012; Dorratoltaj et al. 2017; Bauer et al. 2009). Furthermore, the mechanisms and processes (transmission, replication, pathogen shedding, infection) for infectious disease systems can be modeled for each hierarchical level. These can then be coupled via bridges between the microscale and the macroscale, leading to similar categories of multiscale models which include individual-based multiscale models (IMSMs), nested multiscale models (NMSMs), embedded multiscale models (EMSMs) and hybrid multiscale models (HMSMs) (Garira 2017, 2018; Feng et al. 2012; Murillo et al. 2013; Gandolfi et al. 2014; Yu and Bagheri 2016). Agent(individual)-based models (ABMs or IBMs) are particularly well suited to characterize biological phenomena in a multiscale, multiclass manner. In particular, they can simulate ensembles of individual hosts in time and space, represent detailed information on epidemic states and contribute to our understanding of disease pathology and epidemiology (Sun et al. 2016; Bauer et al. 2009)."
PMC7223857,2020-01-13,Modeling the effect of information transmission on the drug dynamic,"In each community, there is a lot of information about the disadvantages and risks of drug use and its negative effects on health, work, honor, and other living funds of people. A group of individuals, who can be called responsive individuals, will be safe from the risk of drug abuse, by receiving and understanding such information. In this paper, by proposing mathematical models, we investigate the effect of the distribution of this kind of information on the transformation of susceptible individuals into responsive individuals as well as their effect in preventing the occurrence of substance abuse epidemics. In these models, we take into account the fact that the spirit of responsiveness of these individuals can be decayed with time, and these people can become susceptible people, and eventually to addicts. We analyze the dynamical properties of the models, such as local and global stability of equilibrium points and the occurrence of backward bifurcation. The results of this study show that the higher the rate of conversion of susceptible individuals to those responsive, the prevention of drug epidemy is easier.","As far as usage of drugs damages the physical, mental, and social well being of individuals, their families and societies, and drug usage turn into a worldwide social and health problem. Police records, rehabilitation centers, and prisons records show the increase in harmful drug uses, and on the other hand, the literature shows expanded studies undertaken to explore various aspects of drugs such as its relation to media and information, campaigns, criminals, etc., see [23, 24]. Among various drug users, heroin users are at high risk of addiction and criminal actions. As indicated in , “the number of heroin users increased from 166,000 in 2002 to 335,000 in 2012, and the death rate of drug poisoning involving heroin increased from 0.7 to 2.7 per 100,000 persons during 2002–2013 in the USA.

PMC7224159,2020-04-27,The spread and control of rumors in a multilingual environment,"This paper studies the rumor propagation model with heterogeneous networks in a multilingual environment. Firstly, a rumor propagation model with two language spreaders, in which the immunologic mechanism is considered in the ignorant, is proposed on heterogeneous networks. Secondly, the basic reproduction number and the dynamic behaviors are analyzed by using the next-generation matrix method and Lyapunov stability theory, respectively. Moreover, two control strategies are designed to effectively suppress the spread of the rumor. The one is continuous control strategy. By applying real-time control to the spreaders, the rumor spreading time can be greatly reduced and the rumor can die out in a short time. The other is event-triggered impulsive control strategy, which can effectively reduce the consumption of resources and ensure the extinction of the rumor. Finally, the correctness of theoretical analysis and the feasibility of control methods are verified by numerical simulations.","The rumor is unconfirmed information of public opinion, which greatly affects people’s work and life. With the rapid development of Internet information technology, rumor propagation is no longer limited to word of mouth, but relies on the new media of the Internet, such as BBS, SMS, Microblog, QQ, WeChat, Twitter and other social network platforms. For the past few years, a number of emergencies caused by rumors have erupted in China, which have brought huge economic losses to the country and seriously disturbed people’s life order. For example, in 2003, the rumor that banlangen could cure SARS caused residents in many cities around the country to frantically buy up banlangen, which caused a great social panic. In the 2011 nuclear disaster in Japan, the rumor that iodized salt could protect against radiation caused the run on salt. These rumors seriously destroyed the social order and caused social panic. With the advent of information dissemination, there are more and more emergencies caused by rumors. Therefore, it is very significant to study and master the law of rumor propagation in the new era, which can help the government department to prevent and control rumors. Since the form of rumor transmission is similar to disease transmission, based on the disease transmission model, the rumor propagation model is established. In the basic rumor propagation model, the population is divided into three categories Ignorants (people who do not know the rumors), Spreaders (people who know and spread rumors) and Removers (people who know rumors but do not spread them). Early studies on rumor propagation took the classical Daley–Kendall (DK) model in [1, 2] and Maki–Thomson (MT) model in  as examples, which were applicable for the phenomenon of rumor propagation in small-scale social networks with direct contact. In the DK model, the authors assumed that the rumor was spread through the contact of rumor spreaders with other groups in the population. Maki and Thomson  modified the DK model and proposed that rumors were spread through two-way contact between the rumormongers and other people in the crowd, thus deriving the MT model."
PMC7413838,2020-08-08,"Koala retrovirus epidemiology, transmission mode, pathogenesis, and host immune response in koalas (Phascolarctos cinereus): a review","Koala retrovirus (KoRV) is a major threat to koala health and conservation. It also represents a series of challenges across the fields of virology, immunology, and epidemiology that are of great potential interest to any researcher in the field of retroviral diseases. KoRV is a gammaretrovirus that is present in both endogenous and exogenous forms in koala populations, with a still-active endogenization process. KoRV may induce immunosuppression and neoplastic conditions such as lymphoma and leukemia and play a role in chlamydiosis and other diseases in koalas. KoRV transmission modes, pathogenesis, and host immune response still remain unclear, and a clear understanding of these areas is critical for devising effective preventative and therapeutic strategies. Research on KoRV is clearly critical for koala conservation. In this review, we provide an overview of the current understanding and future challenges related to KoRV epidemiology, transmission mode, pathogenesis, and host immune response and discuss prospects for therapeutic and preventive vaccines.","KoRV is now endemic in both wild and captive koalas and represents a major threat to koala health [7, 9, 23, 31–33]. KoRV shows variations in its prevalence depending on the geographical location of the population and the virus subtype [13, 25, 33–35] (Fig. 1). Epidemiolocal research on KoRV in the wild has tended to divide koalas broadly into two populations on the island continent of Australia a northern population with habitats in Queensland and northern New South Wales and a southern population with habitats in Victoria and South Australia. Within the northern population, the prevalence of KoRV provirus is regarded as 100%, with every reported case of testing yielding positive evidence of the presence of a provirus [4, 9, 13, 33] (Table 2). The southern population previously showed a much lower prevalence, reportedly ranging from 14.8 to 25% [8, 13, 34]; however, the three most recent studies have shown markedly higher figures, ranging from 42.4 to 99.0% [25, 33, 35] (Table 2)."
PMC7407078,2020-08-04,Quantifying the Transmission of Foot-and-Mouth Disease Virus in Cattle via a Contaminated Environment,"Indirect transmission via a contaminated environment can occur for a number of pathogens, even those typically thought of as being directly transmitted, such as influenza virus, norovirus, bovine tuberculosis, or foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV). Indirect transmission facilitates spread from multiple sources beyond the infectious host, complicating the epidemiology and control of these diseases. This study carried out a series of transmission experiments to determine the dose-response relationship between environmental contamination and transmission of FMDV in cattle from measurements of viral shedding and rates of environmental contamination and survival. Seven out of ten indirect exposures resulted in successful transmission. The basic reproduction number for environmental transmission of FMDV in this experimental setting was estimated at 1.65, indicating that environmental transmission alone could sustain an outbreak. Importantly, detection of virus in the environment prior to the appearance of clinical signs in infected cattle and successful transmission from these environments highlights there is a risk of environmental transmission even before foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) is clinically apparent in cattle. Estimated viral decay rates suggest that FMDV remained viable in this environment for up to 14 days, emphasizing the requirement for stringent biosecurity procedures following outbreaks of FMD and the design of control measures that reflect the biology of a pathogen.","Failure to account for all pathways involved in disease spread results in a superficial understanding of transmission (1, 2), limiting the effectiveness of control measures and our ability to anticipate how an outbreak could progress. Indirect transmission through contaminated environments can contribute to the epidemiology of diseases primarily considered to be transmitted by direct contact, such as those caused by noroviruses , avian influenza (AIV) , bovine tuberculosis (bTB) , and foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) . In this context, the term “environment” extends to any area that has housed or had contact with an infected individual that is shedding a pathogen. Where pathogens remain viable, environmental contamination facilitates a complex system of spread in which new infections can occur from multiple sources and occasions beyond contact with the infectious host. FMDV infects cloven-hooved livestock and wildlife species and is an important pathogen on economic and animal welfare grounds . It is spread primarily through direct contact between infected and naive animals . However, when control measures to prevent direct contact, such as restrictions on animal movement and culling are imposed, outbreaks can still continue . This sustained spread of the virus can involve transmission modes such as indirect contact via fomites and long-distance transport of aerosols. FMDV is present in all excretions and secretions from acutely infected animals , so environments are readily contaminated. FMDV has been demonstrated to survive outside the host under various conditions (11–14), enabling infectious virus to remain viable in an environment beyond the period in which an animal would potentially be infectious. Contaminated environments are acknowledged as a risk factor for FMDV outbreaks , but only very limited experimental work has been carried out to quantify the role of the environment in transmission ."
PMC7413751,2020-08-07,Exploring collective emotion transmission in face-to-face interactions,"Collective emotion is the synchronous convergence of an effective response across individuals toward a specific event or object. Previous studies have focused on the transmission of cyber collective emotion; however, little attention has been paid to the transmission of collective emotion in face-to-face interactions. Using an experimental design, we examined how emotions are transmitted from some members to the whole group in face-to-face situations. We used a news report of a social event as an emotion stimulus to induce anger and disgust in 158 middle school students aged 12 to 15, with an average age of 13.20 years (SD = 0.651) We randomly assigned one-third of the participants to be “transmitters,” while the others were “receivers.” Transmitters shared their feelings with receivers; then, receivers communicated with other group members. The results indicated that negative collective emotions were transmitted from high- to low-intensity members, which converged through the effect of emotional contagion. It accumulated through the effect of an emotional circle, during which the feedback reinforced emotion intensity. The collective emotion transmission model comprised emotion diffusion, contagion, and accumulation. This model elucidates the intrinsic features of collective emotion transmission, enriches the research on collective emotion, and provides theoretical references for monitoring and managing future public events.","Human emotions are individual, one-way, and unrepeatable phenomena [1,2]. Researchers have increasingly realized that emotions at the collective level play a key role in our daily lives. Collective emotion is the synchronous convergence of an effective response across individuals toward a specific event or object [2,3]. Collective emotions constitute a wide range, such as global panic concerning the coronavirus or the public’s excitement after their country’s win at the Olympics. Ample research has examined cyber collective emotions [4,5]; however, studies on collective emotional transmission in face-to-face situations mainly focus on the dyad interactions [6,7]. A face-to-face situation refers to a condition in which many people gather together in the same spot namely, the formation of an “offline” event. How do people transmit emotions at the collective level? Does this transmission in face-to-face interactions follow the same rules as those of cyber collective emotions? Exploring how collective emotion is transmitted in face-to-face interactions can provide empirical and theoretical support to the understanding of collective emotions and provide further guidance for addressing public events. Researchers have focused on cyber collective emotions using computational simulation or big data [4–10]. The essence of collective emotion transmission is emotional information transmission among group members . Emotion transmission follows the general pattern of information transmission; however, the special features of emotion make emotion transmission different from information transmission. Many studies have addressed the area of information transmission, wherein the epidemic model and the heat transfer model are the most commonly used . However, few studies have considered the psychological process of how emotions are transmitted from one person to another based on the theory of emotion social sharing [12,13] and emotional contagion . This study considered three aspects of emotion diffusion, convergence, and accumulation."
PMC7441222,2020-08-21,Hand hygiene improvement or antibiotic restriction to control the household transmission of extended-spectrum β-lactamase-producing Escherichia coli: a mathematical modelling study," The best strategy to control ESBL-producing Escherichia coli (ESBL-EC) spread in the community is lacking. METHODS We developed an individual-based transmission model to evaluate the impact of hand hygiene (HH) improvement and reduction in antibiotic use on the within-household transmission of ESBL-EC. We used data from the literature and incorporated key elements of ESBL-EC transmission such as the frequency and nature of contacts among household members, antibiotic use in the community and hand hygiene behaviour. We introduced in a household a single ESBL-EC colonised person and simulated the transmission dynamics of ESBL-EC over a one-year time horizon. RESULTS The probability of ESBL-EC transmission depended on the household composition and the profile of the initial carrier. In the two-person household, the probability of ESBL-EC transmission was 5.3% (95% CI 5.0–5.6) or 6.6% (6.3–6.9) when the index person was a woman or a man, respectively. In a four-person household, the probability of transmission varied from 61.4% (60.9–62.0) to 68.8% (68.3–69.3) and was the highest when the index patient was the baby. Improving HH by 50% reduced the probability of transmission by 33–62%. Antibiotic restriction by 50% reduced the transmission by 2–6%. CONCLUSIONS The transmission of ESBL-EC is frequent in households and especially those with a baby. Antibiotic reduction had little impact on ESBL-EC. Improvement of hygiene in the community could help prevent transmission of ESBL-EC.","Over recent years, the prevalence of extended-spectrum β-lactamase-producing Enterobacteriaceae (ESBL-PE) has increased worldwide . Initially, ESBL-PE spread in hospital environments, but currently community-acquired infections caused by ESBL E. coli (ESBL-EC) are also on the rise . Community spread of ESBL-EC is an important public health threat for several reasons gut colonisation amplifies the reservoir of community pathogens and the introduction of resistance into hospitals; infections caused by ESBL-EC lead to inadequate antibiotic therapy; and ESBL-EC infections are associated with consumption of last resort antibiotics, favouring the emergence of carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae."
PMC7471418,2019-11-04,DL0410 ameliorates cognitive deficits in APP/PS1 transgenic mice by promoting synaptic transmission and reducing neuronal loss,"At present, few available drugs can be used to either improve pathological features or prevent the progression of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). DL0410 ((1,1′-([1,1′-biphenyl]-4,4′-diyl) bis (3-(piperidin-1-yl) propan-1-one) dihydrochloride) is a multiple-target small molecule that has been found to reverse cognitive impairment in different animal models of AD. In this study we evaluated the cognition-improving effects of DL0410 in APP/PS1 transgenic mice and explored the underlying mechanisms. APP/PS1 transgenic mice were administered DL0410 (3, 10, 30 mg· kg(−1)· d(−1), ig) for 2 months. We found that DL0410 administration significantly ameliorated cognitive deficits in both the nest-building and Morris water maze tests. In electrophysiological analysis of hippocampal slices, we showed that DL0410 administration significantly enhanced the field EPSP slope and HFS-induced LTP in CA1 area. Furthermore, we revealed that DL0410 administration significantly increased the phosphorylation of AKT and the activity of GSK-3β in the hippocampus and cortex. Moreover, DL0410 administration dose-dependently increased the expression level of phosphorylated ERK1/2 in the hippocampus and cortex. In addition, DL0410 dose-dependently decreased the neuronal loss by decreasing the production of Aβ deposition, inhibited glial overactivation, and the production of inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6. We conclude that DL0410 ameliorates cognitive deficits in APP/PS1 transgenic mice by promoting synaptic transmission via activating the AKT/GSK-3β and MAPK/ERK signaling pathway and reducing neuronal loss. DL0410 may be an effective agent for AD treatment in the future.","Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a complex and progressive neurodegenerative disease. It is estimated that over 2.1 billion people will be affected worldwide by the year 2050 , and it is becoming the great health care challenge in the 21st century. At present, little is known about the cause of AD, and no curative treatments are available. β-Amyloid protein (Aβ) deposits and neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) are the typical pathological features of AD, but clinical trials targeting Aβ, including MK-8931 and solanezumab, have all failed [2–5]. Hence, it is important and necessary to identify treatment strategies besides single-target drugs based on the Aβ cascade hypothesis. A growing number of researchers have determined that multitarget drugs may be potentially helpful for curbing the progression of AD. Increasing evidence has demonstrated that the progressive loss of synapses is an important characteristic of AD. Synapses are the sites of memory storage in the nervous system and the mechanism by which information is transferred, suggesting a relationship between synaptic plasticity degeneration and cognitive decline in AD [6, 7]. Long-term potentiation (LTP) has been widely used for evaluating synaptic plasticity both in vitro and in vivo. In terms of pathological mechanisms, the PI3K/AKT/GSK-3β and MAPK/ERK signaling pathways play an important role in AD. AKT (also known as protein kinase B) is a serine/threonine kinase that is believed to promote cell viability in many different cell types, including neurons, by phosphorylating and then inactivating downstream molecules such as the serine/threonine kinase glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK-3β) and the apoptosis-inhibiting factor Bcl-2. GSK-3 has also been reported to be an important kinase in tau phosphorylation in the central nervous system [8–11]. In addition, the MAPK/ERK signaling pathway and downstream transcription factors are associated with the activation of genomic programs involved in synaptic plasticity and the encoding of long-term memories [12, 13]."
PMC7476247,2020-09-07,"Cessation of breastfeeding and associated factors in the era of elimination of mother to child transmission of HIV at Ndejje health center, Uganda: a retrospective cohort study"," Breastfeeding an infant exposed to Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) carries the risk of HIV acquisition whilst not breastfeeding poses a higher risk of death from malnutrition, diarrhea, and pneumonia. In Uganda, mothers living with HIV are encouraged to discontinue breastfeeding at 12 months but data are limited. We examined the frequency and factors associated with cessation of breastfeeding at 1 year among mothers living with HIV at Ndejje Health Center IV, a large peri-urban health facility in Uganda. METHODS This retrospective cohort study involved all mothers living with HIV and enrolled in HIV care for ≥12 months between June 2014 and June 2018. We abstracted data from registers, held focus group discussions with mothers living with HIV and key informant interviews with healthcare providers. Cessation of breastfeeding was defined as the proportion of mothers living with HIV who had discontinued breastfeeding at 1 year. We summarized quantitative data descriptively, tested differences in outcome using Chi-square and t - tests, and established independently associated factors using modified Poisson regression analysis at 5% statistical significance level. We thematically analyzed qualitative data to enrich and triangulate the quantitative results. RESULTS Of 235 participants, 150 (63.8%) had ceased breastfeeding at 1 year and this was independently associated with the infant being male (Adjusted Risk Ratio [aRR] 1.25, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.04, 1.50), the mother being multiparous (aRR 1.26, 95% CI 1.04–1.53), and the initiation of breastfeeding being on the same-day as birth (aRR 0.06, 95% CI 0.01–0.41). The reasons for ceasing breastfeeding included male infants over breastfeed than females, maternal literacy and knowledge adequacy about breastfeeding, support and reminders from the partner, and boys can bite once they get teeth. CONCLUSION Suboptimal proportion of infants were ceased from breastfeeding at 1 year and this might increase the risk of mother to child transmission of HIV. Cessation of breastfeeding was more likely among male infants and multiparous mothers but less likely when breastfeeding was initiated on the same-day as birth. Interventions to enhance cessation of breastfeeding should target none multiparous mothers and those with female infants.","In sub-Sahara African region (SSA), an estimated 60% of infants born to mothers living with Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) acquire HIV during pregnancy, delivery, or breastfeeding . In Uganda, the rate of mother to child transmission of HIV (MTCT) falls within the range of 5–30% , and the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS estimates that 1.4 million people were living with HIV, with 740,000 being women aged ≥15 years in 2018 . Following the scale up of elimination of mother to child transmission of HIV (EMTCT) Option B Plus policy, at least 90% of pregnant women living with HIV are now on lifelong anti-retroviral therapy (ART) . The increasing number of women on EMTCT program is attributed to accreditation of many lower level health facilities to provide ART to both pregnant and breastfeeding women living with HIV . Although EMTCT has led to an estimated 86% reduction in HIV infection among children between 2010 and 2016, 14% of infants are infected with HIV during breastfeeding, which is still high . In mothers living with HIV, breastfeeding is recommended because it protects infants exposed to HIV (hereafter termed as infants) from morbidity and mortality. A scoping review of breastfeeding among pregnant women living with HIV included 35 studies in sub Saharan Africa, found that healthcare workers’ personal biases, inadequate counselling skills, mother’s limited knowledge about EMTCT, a culture of mixed feeding norms, maternal lack of decision-making power, limited follow-up of mothers after delivery, and HIV related stigma associated with replacement feeding are some of the factors that hinder cessation of breastfeeding at 1 year among women living with HIV ."
PMC7477833,2020-08-26,Hepatitis a virus infection in Central-West Tunisia: an age structured model of transmission and vaccination impact," The epidemiological pattern of hepatitis A infection has shown dynamic changes in many parts of the world due to improved socio-economic conditions and the accumulation of seronegative subjects, which leads to possible outbreaks and increased morbidity rate. In Tunisia, the epidemiological status of hepatits A virus is currently unknown. However, over the past years higher numbers of symptomatic hepatitis A virus infection in school attendants and several outbreaks were reported to the Ministry of Health, especially from regions with the lowest socio-economic levels in the country. The aim of this study was to investigate the current seroprevalence of hepatitis A virus antibodies in central-west Tunisia and assess the impact of hepatitis A virus vaccination on hepatitis A epidemiology. METHODS Serum samples from 1379 individuals, aged 5–75 years, were screened for hepatitis A virus antibodies. Adjusted seroprevalence, incidence and force of infection parameters were estimated by a linear age structured SEIR (Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Recovered) compartmental model. A vaccine model was then constructed to assess the impact on hepatitis A virus epidemiology of 3 scenarios of vaccination strategies one dose at 12-months of age, one dose at 6-years and one dose at 12-months and another at 6-years of age during 6 years. RESULTS A rapid increase in anti-hepatitis A virus seroprevalence was noted during infancy and adolescence 47% of subjects under 10-years-old are infected; the prevalence increases to 77% at 15-years and reaches 97% in subjects aged 30-years. The force of infection is highest between 10 and 30-years of age and the incidence declines with increasing age. The vaccine model showed that the 3-scenarios lead to a significant reduction of the fraction of susceptibles. The two doses scenario gives the best results. Single-dose vaccination at 6-years of age provides more rapid decrease of disease burden in school-aged children, as compared to single-dose vaccination at 12-months, but keeps with a non-negligible fraction of susceptibles among children < 6-years. CONCLUSIONS Our study confirms the epidemiological switch from high to intermediate endemicity of hepatitis A virus in Tunisia and provides models that may help undertake best decisions in terms of vaccinations strategies.","Hepatitis A virus (HAV) is a non-enveloped RNA Picornavirus, responsible annually for almost 1.5 million cases of acute hepatitis . It is the most common cause of acute viral hepatitis worldwide, causing substantial morbidity, with tens of millions of infected cases worldwide . However, the true incidence of the disease remains underestimated due to the high frequency of asymptomatic forms and of symptomatic forms that are not reported . Hepatitis A virus is mainly transmitted through fecal-oral route either by direct contact of a susceptible person with an infectious person (generally through contaminated hands) or by ingestion of contaminated food or water . It usually causes a self-limiting liver infection, especially in children, with a benign clinical course and no evolution to chronicity. It may occasionally progress to severe disease, especially among elderly population [3, 4]. Different geographical patterns of HAV infection exist, correlating with sanitary conditions and development indicators . The infection occurs more frequently in populations of less economically-developed regions with little education and poor hygiene . Due to improved socio-economic conditions, the epidemiological pattern of hepatitis A infection recently changed in many parts of the world, including Asia, Latin America, Eastern Europe and the Middle East [2, 7–16]. Although this represents a positive indicator for socio-economic development, it leads to possible outbreaks due to the accumulation of seronegative subjects [17, 18] and increased morbidity rate as a result of the increased age of primary infection."
PMC7477864,2020-06-12,Simulating transmission of ESKAPE pathogens plus C. difficile in relevant clinical scenarios," The prevalence of healthcare-acquired infections (HAI) and rising levels of antimicrobial resistance places significant economic and public health burdens on modern healthcare systems. A group of highly drug resistant pathogens known as the ESKAPE pathogens, along with C. difficile, are the leading causes of HAIs. Interactions between patients, healthcare workers, and environmental conditions impact disease transmission. Studying pathogen transfer under varying contact scenarios in a controlled manner is critical for understanding transmission and disinfectant strategies. In lieu of human subject research, this method has the potential to contribute to modeling the routes of pathogen transmission in healthcare settings. METHODS To overcome these challenges, we have developed a method that utilizes a synthetic skin surrogate to model both direct (skin-to-skin) and indirect (skin-to fomite-to skin) pathogen transfer between infected patients and healthy healthcare workers. This surrogate material includes a background microbiome community simulating typical human skin flora to more accurately mimic the effects of natural flora during transmission events. RESULTS We demonstrate the ability to modulate individual bacterial concentrations within this microbial community to mimic bacterial concentrations previously reported on the hands of human subjects. We also explore the effect of various decontamination approaches on pathogen transfer between human subjects, such as the use of handwashing or surface disinfectants. Using this method, we identify a potential outlier, S. aureus, that may persist and retain viability in specific transfer conditions better than the overall microbial community during decontamination events. CONCLUSIONS Our work describes the development of an in vitro method that uses a synthetic skin surrogate with a defined background microbiota to simulate skin-to-skin and skin-to fomite-to skin contact scenarios. These results illustrate the value of simulating a holistic microbial community for transfer studies by elucidating differences in different pathogen transmission rates and resistance to common decontamination practices. We believe this method will contribute to improvements in pathogen transmission modeling in healthcare settings and increase our ability to assess the risk associated with HAIs, although additional research is required to establish the degree of correlation of pathogen transmission by skin or synthetic alternatives.","Healthcare-acquired infections (HAIs) and increasing levels of antimicrobial resistance, particularly among HAI-associated pathogens, represent a significant source of morbidity and mortality cost in the US healthcare system . Understanding the dynamics of pathogen transmission and transfer between patients, healthcare workers, and surrounding environmental surfaces is critical to evaluate potential intervention methods, identify possible environmental HAI reservoirs or fomites, and to delineate pathogen-specific transmission behaviors [2–5]. Ethical restrictions on human subject research complicates experimental analysis of human-to-human pathogen transfer. Retrospective studies on HAI outbreaks do not provide experimentally changeable parameters. Thus, there is a need for in vitro methods to study these types of transmission scenarios. The ESKAPE pathogens (Enterococcus faecium, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Enterobacter species)  are a group of Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria characterized by drug-resistance [6, 7]. Taken together with Clostridioides difficile, which is often caused by antibiotic-induced disruption of the native gut microbiota , these pathogens (here termed ESKAPE+C) collectively are the leading cause of nosocomial infections [6, 7]. These pathogens employ diverse mechanisms of drug resistance, such as drug inactivation, active site modification, efflux pumps, and biofilm formation, leading to multidrug-resistant (MDR) strains and a need for novel antibiotics [6, 7, 9, 10]. As a result of their clinical impact, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), with the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), maintains the Antibiotic Resistance (AR) Isolate Bank which maintains and curates multiple, well-characterized strains of ESKAPE pathogens and isolate panels, a resource that was utilized for this effort ."
PMC7543230,2011-01-21,Direct imaging of pH1N1 2009 influenza virus replication in alveolar pneumocytes in fatal cases by transmission electron microscopy,"Human influenza virus pandemics constitute a major global public health issue. Although studies on autopsy specimens from the recent pandemic by the 2009 influenza A (H1N1) virus have revealed a broad spectrum of pathologic findings, direct electron microscopic studies of the lung tissue from influenza fatalities are few. In this study, we examined five well-preserved pulmonary necropsy specimens from fatal cases of laboratory-confirmed pH1N1 from India. The novel observations in comparison with earlier reports included direct imaging of influenza virus budding within dilated cisternae of pneumocytes, cell-free virus emerging from the cell membrane of a pneumocyte in the alveolar lumen, presence of polymorphonuclear cells with red blood cells as inflammatory exudates close to hyaline membranes and extensive cytoplasmic degeneration of epithelial cells of the alveolar lining. These observations are in consistent with the earlier findings and emphasize the possible role of this virus directly infecting cells of the lower respiratory tract as a key event in the rapid pathogenesis of pH1N1 disease process.","This work was funded by the Indian Council of Medical Research, Government of India. Although the present study was a part of pandemic disease investigation process, institutional ethical and IBSC approvals were obtained. The fatal cases have been treated as anonymous."
PMC7543040,2020-10-08,"Age-dependent carriage of alleles and haplotypes of Plasmodium falciparum sera5, eba-175, and csp in a region of intense malaria transmission in Uganda"," The development of malaria vaccines is constrained by genetic polymorphisms exhibited by Plasmodium falciparum antigens. The project the age-dependent distribution of alleles or haplotypes of three P. falciparum malaria vaccine candidates, Circumsporozoite Protein (csp), Erythrocyte Binding Antigen 175 (eba-175) and Serine Repeat Antigen 5 (sera5) in a region of intense malaria transmission in Uganda. METHODS A cross-sectional study was carried out between August and November 2009 in which 250 study participants were selected from a population of 600. Finger prick blood samples were collected after informed consent from participants below 5 years, 5–10 years, and above 10 years of age. Blood was used for microscopy, RDT and dried blood spots. Plasmodium falciparum DNA was extracted by chelex method. Alleles of sera5 and eba-175 were determined by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification followed by resolution of products by agarose gel electrophoresis. Allele calling was done using gel photographs from ethiduim bromide stained gels. Haplotypes of csp were identified by sequencing 63 PCR products using the P. falciparum 7G8 laboratory strain sequence as a reference. The data were analysed using SPSS 16, EQX for windows and Chi-square test was used to calculate associations (P-values), Excel was used to generate graphs. The BioEdit and NCBI blast software programs were used to analyse the sequences from which csp haplotypes map was constructed. RESULTS Eba-175 FCR3 (48/178) and CAMP (16/178) alleles were observed, the FCR3 (24/67) allele being predominant among children aged below 5 years old while the CAMP (12/67) allele was predominant among older participants. Sera5 alleles ORI (6/204) and ORII (103/204) were observed in the population, ORII was more prevalent and was significantly associated with age (P values < 0.0001), parasite density (P-value < 0.0001) and clinical outcomes (P value = 0.018). There was marked csp diversity in the Th2/Th3 region. Out of 63 sequences, 16 conformed to the reference strain and one (1/16) was similar to a West African haplotype and the majority (14/16) of the haplotypes were unique to this study region. There was an age-dependent distribution of csp haplotypes with more haplotypes being harbored by children < 5-year of age, (10/16) compared to adults (2/16). Interestingly, the csp haplotype corresponding to 3D7 whose prototypical sequence is identical to the sequence of the leading malaria vaccine candidate RTS, S was not observed. CONCLUSION This data suggest that the eba-175 FCR3 allele, sera5 ORII allele, and csp haplotypes are targets of host immunity and under immune selection pressure in Apac District. These molecules could provide alternative malaria vaccine candidates as sub-unit vaccines.","Malaria is one of the most severe public health problems worldwide. It is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in many developing countries, where young children and pregnant women are most affected. Nearly half the world’s population lives in areas at risk of malaria transmission in 91 countries and territories. In 2016, malaria caused an estimated 216 million clinical episodes, and 445,000 deaths. An estimated 90% of deaths in 2016 were in the World Health Organization (WHO) African Region . In addition, malaria also causes an unmeasured impact on local economies, human health in general, and longevity . The burden of disease falls mainly on three vulnerable groups young children under 5 years of age, pregnant women especially the primigravidae in sub-Saharan Africa  and persons infected with HIV/AIDS. In Uganda, malaria contributes the major share of the disease burden to the public health system with 93% of the total population at great risk of developing the disease, 25–30% of all outpatient visits, and 35% of in-patient admissions are attributable to malaria alone . There are periodic epidemic outbreaks in South-Western Uganda, while the rest of the country has a stable transmission. Control measures that have been greatly exploited include early diagnosis and prompt treatment, particularly among those at risk of death and severe complications such as young children and pregnant women. Others are improved diagnosis and prophylactic chemotherapy, as well as integrated vector control through the use of insecticide-treated bed nets and indoor residual house spraying . However, over the years, control and treatment was made complicated by the emergence and spread of resistance to insecticides as well as to the inexpensive anti-malarial drugs, chloroquine and sulfadoxine–pyrimethamine , which are still used in Uganda for prophylaxis but not as first-line therapies . An effective malaria vaccine will have the potential for the induction of appropriate humoral and cellular immune responses, against several key parasite antigens expressed during the various stages of the parasite life cycle. Each stage in the life cycle provides an opportunity for a vaccine since different proteins are expressed which favor the survival and proliferation of the parasite. Several vaccine candidate antigens are currently under development, these include parasitic and blood-stage antigens , such as Circumsporozoite Protein (csp), Serine Repeat Antigen 5 (sera5), and Erythrocyte Binding Antigen-175 (eba-175). CSP, the major component of the most advanced malaria vaccine candidate (RTS,S) is found on the surface of sporozoites. This protein contains two major B cell epitopes consisting of tandem repeats (Asn-Ala-Asn-Pro and Asn-Val-Asn-Pro). Another vaccine candidate that has been considered is based on the sera5, also known as the P126 antigen. This is the largest parasite protein, it accumulates in the parasitophorous vacuole of trophozoites and schizonts and is processed into three fragments (18 kDa, 47 kDa, and 50 kDa) . Human clinical trials have established that sera5 derived BK-SE36 candidate vaccine is not only safe and immunogenic but protects children against malaria attacks over a year of follow up. Field studies have shown that high titers of IgG anti-SE36 antibodies are associated with protection against malaria in Ugandan children, adults and against placental malaria and low birth weights in pregnant women . Eba-175 of P. falciparum is localized in the merozoites and is thought to be one of the key players during the fast cascade of interactions between the parasite and host molecules before the merozoites completely invade the erythrocyte . As part of the project’s efforts to prepare for future clinical trials in northern Uganda, the project investigated polymorphisms and allele baseline frequencies of three malaria vaccine candidate antigens csp, eba-175, and sera5. This was to obtain baseline data on these antigen alleles in an area of high malaria endemicity. The study was conducted on the hypothesis that there is no significant association between candidate antigen polymorphisms and participant’s age, clinical presentation/outcomes and parasite density. The study was conducted in Apac District, a rural district in Northern Uganda located between Kwania Lake and the Victoria Nile (latitude 1.985; longitude 32.535). Apac District covers an area of 6684 square kilometres and ranges in altitude between 1350 and 1500 m above sea level. The rainfall pattern is bimodal with a dry season from November to February and two short rainy seasons from April to May and from September to October. According to surveys conducted in 2001–2002, this area experiences perennial holoendemic malaria , with parasite prevalence rates of 70–90% in children < 10 years of age [10–12]. The entomological inoculation rate was estimated at > 1500 infective bites per person per year and the major vector responsible for transmission is Anopheles funestus . Plasmodium falciparum is the dominant parasite species, Plasmodium malariae being responsible for ~ 3% of the infections and Plasmodium ovale was previously not observed "
PMC7579852,2020-10-22,Real-time PCR on skin biopsies for super-spreaders’ detection in bovine besnoitiosis," Bovine besnoitiosis, an emerging disease in Europe that can be transmitted by vectors, is caused by the apicomplexan Besnoitia besnoiti. Bovine besnoitiosis is difficult to control due to the complexity of its diagnosis in the acute stage of the disease, poor treatment success and chronically asymptomatic cattle acting as parasite reservoirs. When serological prevalence is low, detection and specific culling of seropositive cattle is feasible; however, economic considerations preclude this approach when serological prevalence is high. The aims of this study were to evaluate the accuracy of detection of super-spreaders in highly infected herds and to test their selective elimination as a new control strategy for bovine besnoitiosis. METHODS Previous real-time PCR analyses performed on skin tissues from 160 asymptomatic animals sampled at slaughterhouses showed that the tail base was the best location to evaluate the dermal parasite DNA load. All seropositive animals (n = 518) from eight dairy or beef cattle farms facing a high serological prevalence of besnoitiosis were sampled at the tail base and their skin sample analysed by real-time PCR. A recommendation of rapid and selective culling of super-spreaders was formulated and provided to the cattle breeders. Subsequent serological monitoring of naïve animals was used to evaluate the interest of this control strategy over time. RESULTS Among the 518 seropositive animals, a low proportion of individuals (14.5%) showed Cq values below 36, 17.8% had doubtful results (36 < Cq ≤ 40) and 67.8% had negative PCR results. These proportions were grossly similar on the eight farms, regardless of their production type (beef or dairy cattle), size, geographical location or history of besnoitiosis. Within two weeks of the biopsy, the rapid culling of super-spreaders was implemented on only three farms. The numbers of newly infected animals were lower on these farms compared to those where super-spreaders were maintained in the herd. CONCLUSIONS Real-time PCR analyses performed on skin biopsies of seropositive cattle showed huge individual variabilities in parasite DNA load. The rapid culling of individuals considered as super-spreaders seems to be a new and encouraging strategy for bovine besnoitiosis control. [Image see text]","Bovine besnoitiosis is a re-emerging protozoan disease in Europe caused by the cyst-forming apicomplexan parasite Besnoitia besnoiti [1, 2]. The tachyzoite and bradyzoite stages of the parasite develop in the cattle host and are respectively responsible for the acute and chronic phases of this disease. During the acute stage of the disease, tachyzoites multiply quickly within bovine macrophages and endothelial cells of blood vessels . The subsequent chronic phase, which can last several years, is characterized by massive skin alterations resulting from the formation of numerous cysts containing thousands of bradyzoites. This chronic and debilitating disease is responsible for heavy economic losses in cattle, and sometimes death. However, in most infected and seropositive cattle, no obvious clinical signs are observed. The transmission routes of B. besnoiti have long been the subject of debate. No definitive hosts have been identified in Europe , no parasite DNA has been detected in semen of B. besnoiti infected bulls  and transplacental or colostral transmission is unlikely . The presence of parasite cysts in the skin suggests that the main mode of transmission is likely mechanical, with hematophagous flies transmitting the parasite as experimentally demonstrated by Bigalke  and Sharif et al. . Bigalke  regarded chronic cases as being of greater importance as sources for susceptible cattle than acute cases and Sharif et al. , demonstrated that a low number of stable flies (n = 300) were able to transmit bradyzoites from a chronically infected cow to a susceptible recipient host. The experiments of Bigalke  have clearly shown that clinically and even some asymptomatic long-lasting infected cases of besnoitiosis act as very efficient sources of infection for susceptible animals."
PMC7584150,2020-04-25,Adaptive Estimation for Epidemic Renewal and Phylogenetic Skyline Models,"Estimating temporal changes in a target population from phylogenetic or count data is an important problem in ecology and epidemiology. Reliable estimates can provide key insights into the climatic and biological drivers influencing the diversity or structure of that population and evidence hypotheses concerning its future growth or decline. In infectious disease applications, the individuals infected across an epidemic form the target population. The renewal model estimates the effective reproduction number, R, of the epidemic from counts of observed incident cases. The skyline model infers the effective population size, N, underlying a phylogeny of sequences sampled from that epidemic. Practically, R measures ongoing epidemic growth while N informs on historical caseload. While both models solve distinct problems, the reliability of their estimates depends on p-dimensional piecewise-constant functions. If p is misspecified, the model might underfit significant changes or overfit noise and promote a spurious understanding of the epidemic, which might misguide intervention policies or misinform forecasts. Surprisingly, no transparent yet principled approach for optimizing p exists. Usually, p is heuristically set, or obscurely controlled via complex algorithms. We present a computable and interpretable p-selection method based on the minimum description length (MDL) formalism of information theory. Unlike many standard model selection techniques, MDL accounts for the additional statistical complexity induced by how parameters interact. As a result, our method optimizes p so that R and N estimates properly and meaningfully adapt to available data. It also outperforms comparable Akaike and Bayesian information criteria on several classification problems, given minimal knowledge of the parameter space, and exposes statistical similarities among renewal, skyline, and other models in biology. Rigorous and interpretable model selection is necessary if trustworthy and justifiable conclusions are to be drawn from piecewise models.

The SEIR model curves have nearly the same shapes as the SIR ones, but with a stretch factor applied to them across time that is related to the ratio of the incubation to infectious periods.

PMC7660488,2020-11-12,A mathematical model and inference method for bacterial colonization in hospital units applied to active surveillance data for carbapenem-resistant enterobacteriaceae,"Widespread use of antibiotics has resulted in an increase in antimicrobial-resistant microorganisms. Although not all bacterial contact results in infection, patients can become asymptomatically colonized, increasing the risk of infection and pathogen transmission. Consequently, many institutions have begun active surveillance, but in non-research settings, the resulting data are often incomplete and may include non-random testing, making conventional epidemiological analysis problematic. We describe a mathematical model and inference method for in-hospital bacterial colonization and transmission of carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae that is tailored for analysis of active surveillance data with incomplete observations. The model and inference method make use of the full detailed state of the hospital unit, which takes into account the colonization status of each individual in the unit and not only the number of colonized patients at any given time. The inference method computes the exact likelihood of all possible histories consistent with partial observations (despite the exponential increase in possible states that can make likelihood calculation intractable for large hospital units), includes techniques to improve computational efficiency, is tested by computer simulation, and is applied to active surveillance data from a 13-bed rehabilitation unit in New York City. The inference method for exact likelihood calculation is applicable to other Markov models incorporating incomplete observations. The parameters that we identify are the patient–patient transmission rate, pre-existing colonization probability, and prior-to-new-patient transmission probability. Besides identifying the parameters, we predict the effects on the total prevalence (0.07 of the total colonized patient-days) of changing the parameters and estimate the increase in total prevalence attributable to patient–patient transmission (0.02) above the baseline pre-existing colonization (0.05). Simulations with a colonized versus uncolonized long-stay patient had 44% higher total prevalence, suggesting that the long-stay patient may have been a reservoir of transmission. High-priority interventions may include isolation of incoming colonized patients and repeated screening of long-stay patients.","Carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE) are a rising global health threat [1–7]. CRE are a family of antibiotic-resistant, gram-negative enteric bacteria  that harbor resistance to many “last line” treatment drugs  and include human pathogens such as Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae, and Escherichia coli . The unusual combination of pathogenicity  and antimicrobial resistance  of CRE renders it a major cause of morbidity and mortality in hospitalized patients  and, increasingly, otherwise healthy hosts . These pathogens are not only resistant to the carbapenems, but to many or most other classes of antibiotics that are effective and safe , such as broad-spectrum cephalosporins. Treatment of CRE with polymyxins and aminoglycosides is complicated by efficacy, pharmocokinetics, and toxicity . Recently introduced treatment options such as meropenem-vaborbactam  or ceftazidime-avibactam are expensive , and clinical experience with their use is limited . Although not all bacterial contact results in infection, patients can become asymptomatically colonized , leading to a higher probability of transmission to other patients , extended length of stay, increased carbapenem exposure, or infection, which increases mortality risk [17, 18] as high as 70% for patients in intensive care units . As a result, the Centers for Disease Control has recommended active surveillance of patients at high risk . Active surveillance, or screening without suspicion of infection, can identify asymptomatic carriers [20, 21] for subsequent intervention with infection control measures such as the use of contact precautions, decolonization, patient cohorting, or minimization of the use of invasive devices [15, 19], and may decrease rates of nosocomial transmission  and reduce morbidity, mortality, and hospitalization costs [23, 24]."
PMC7803761,2021-01-12,Inferring high-resolution human mixing patterns for disease modeling,"Mathematical and computational modeling approaches are increasingly used as quantitative tools in the analysis and forecasting of infectious disease epidemics. The growing need for realism in addressing complex public health questions is, however, calling for accurate models of the human contact patterns that govern the disease transmission processes. Here we present a data-driven approach to generate effective population-level contact matrices by using highly detailed macro (census) and micro (survey) data on key socio-demographic features. We produce age-stratified contact matrices for 35 countries, including 277 sub-national administratvie regions of 8 of those countries, covering approximately 3.5 billion people and reflecting the high degree of cultural and societal diversity of the focus countries. We use the derived contact matrices to model the spread of airborne infectious diseases and show that sub-national heterogeneities in human mixing patterns have a marked impact on epidemic indicators such as the reproduction number and overall attack rate of epidemics of the same etiology. The contact patterns derived here are made publicly available as a modeling tool to study the impact of socio-economic differences and demographic heterogeneities across populations on the epidemiology of infectious diseases.","Mathematical and computational models of infectious disease transmission are increasingly used to provide scenario analysis and forecasts during epidemic outbreaks and quantitative answers to complex public health questions such as devising the effectiveness of control strategies (vaccination, school closure, etc.) during health threat emergencies1. Modeling approaches have thus moved away from the classic homogeneous and stylized framework2,3, progressively incorporating heterogeneities that depend on between- and within-country population variability, disease timescale, transmission settings, as well as specific pathogen characteristics. For instance, geographically structured models allow evaluation of spatially heterogeneous interventions in both animal and human diseases4,5, while individual-based models lay down the possibility of simulating all micro-details of the transmission process and tracking in time and space each individual of the simulated population6–8. When data-driven, these approaches have highlighted the importance of the social, demographic, and economic characteristics of the population in determining the actual mesh of contacts underlying disease spreading among individuals. For this reason, a broad range of methodologies have been used to study human-mixing patterns, including surveys9–12, contact diaries13–19, wearable sensors20,21, analysis of time-use data22, development of synthetic populations23–25, and mixed approaches for instance integrating diary-based contact data with time-use data26,27 or combining contact data with modeling techniques26,28,29. However, each methodology has different limitations and assumptions because contact patterns among individuals vary according to the geographical scale (from census blocks to the national level), the disease under consideration, and the detailed socio-economic and demographic characteristics of the population. Here, we present a data-driven approach to generate effective descriptions of complex contact patterns that can be used to inform infectious disease modeling approaches, including the widely adopted compartmental modeling framework. We make use of highly detailed macro (census) and micro (survey) data from publicly available sources on key socio-demographic features (e.g., age structure, household composition and members’ age gaps, employment rates, school structure) to construct synthetic populations of interacting agents, each one representing a hypothetical individual in the real population. The proposed method relies on both macro- and micro-level data for multiple socioeconomic characteristics and can be adapted to different geographical contexts and diseases; something that is not possible in a “one-model-fits-all” approach."

In this study, we have developed mathematical models to investigate transmission dynamics between humans, animals, and a contaminated environment. We compared different leptospire transmission models involving flooding and weather conditions, shedding and multiplication rate in a contaminated environment. We found that the model in which the transmission rate depends on both flooding and temperature, best-fits the reported human data on leptospirosis in Thailand. Our results indicate that flooding strongly contributes to disease transmission, where a high degree of flooding leads to a higher number of infected individuals. Sensitivity analysis showed that the transmission rate of leptospires from a contaminated environment was the most important parameter for the total number of human cases. Our results suggest that public education should target people who work in contaminated environments to prevent Leptospira infections.","Leptospirosis is a worldwide zoonotic bacterial disease that is particularly endemic in tropical and subtropical countries1,2. The infection of humans is mainly caused by direct contact with an infected animal and also by indirect contact with urine of infected animals through cuts in the skin or mucous membranes in a contaminated environment1,3. In humans, the epidemic of leptospirosis occurs annually. The highest number of cases reported in Thailand is during the rainy season from mid-May to mid-October4. High-risk groups include farmers and other agricultural workers, who are likely to come into contact with infected animals, and contaminated wet soil and water during their daily activities5–7. In addition, leptospirosis in livestock is also considered an important disease, causing reproductive failures (such as abortion, embryonic death, stillbirths, and weak offspring), decreased milk production and growth rates8–11. A relatively high prevalence of leptospirosis has been detected in the urine of cattle and buffalo in Thailand11. Contact with infected livestock increases the risk of infection12. These spirochete bacteria are mainly transmitted through injured or cut skin in contact with contaminated water or soil. Leptospires may survive from a few weeks to almost a year in surface water or wet soil, even during the dry season13."
PMC7844018,2021-01-28,The effect of the definition of ‘pandemic’ on quantitative assessments of infectious disease outbreak risk,"In the early stages of an outbreak, the term ‘pandemic’ can be used to communicate about infectious disease risk, particularly by those who wish to encourage a large-scale public health response. However, the term lacks a widely accepted quantitative definition. We show that, under alternate quantitative definitions of ‘pandemic’, an epidemiological metapopulation model produces different estimates of the probability of a pandemic. Critically, we show that using different definitions alters the projected effects of key parameters—such as inter-regional travel rates, degree of pre-existing immunity, and heterogeneity in transmission rates between regions—on the risk of a pandemic. Our analysis provides a foundation for understanding the scientific importance of precise language when discussing pandemic risk, illustrating how alternative definitions affect the conclusions of modelling studies. This serves to highlight that those working on pandemic preparedness must remain alert to the variability in the use of the term ‘pandemic’, and provide specific quantitative definitions when undertaking one of the types of analysis that we show to be sensitive to the pandemic definition.","In the early stages of an infectious disease outbreak, it is important to determine whether the pathogen responsible may go on to cause an epidemic or a pandemic1–5. There is extensive literature on determining the probability of a major epidemic given a small population of initial infected hosts6–9.

PMC7857595,2021-02-03,Relevance of intra-hospital patient movements for the spread of healthcare-associated infections within hospitals - a mathematical modeling study,"The aim of this study is to analyze patient movement patterns between hospital departments to derive the underlying intra-hospital movement network, and to assess if movement patterns differ between patients at high or low risk of colonization. For that purpose, we analyzed patient electronic medical record data from five hospitals to extract information on risk stratification and patient intra-hospital movements. Movement patterns were visualized as networks, and network centrality measures were calculated. Next, using an agent-based model where agents represent patients and intra-hospital patient movements were explicitly modeled, we simulated the spread of multidrug resistant enterobacteriacae (MDR-E) inside a hospital. Risk stratification of patients according to certain ICD-10 codes revealed that length of stay, patient age, and mean number of movements per admission were higher in the high-risk groups. Movement networks in all hospitals displayed a high variability among departments concerning their network centrality and connectedness with a few highly connected departments and many weakly connected peripheral departments. Simulating the spread of a pathogen in one hospital network showed positive correlation between department prevalence and network centrality measures. This study highlights the importance of intra-hospital patient movements and their possible impact on pathogen spread. Targeting interventions to departments of higher (weighted) degree may help to control the spread of MDR-E. Moreover, when the colonization status of patients coming from different departments is unknown, a ranking system based on department centralities may be used to design more effective interventions that mitigate pathogen spread.","Multidrug resistant enterobacteriacae (MDR-E) are a common cause of hospital-acquired infections (HAIs) [1–4] and are considered a major public health threat. HAIs due to MDR-E are associated with higher morbidity, mortality, and healthcare costs [5,6]. A better understanding of the transmission routes of MDR-E pathogens may provide valuable insight to develop more effective and targeted infection control measures. When dealing with the spread of MDR-E in a single hospital, several factors such as contact precautions, inadequate hygiene protocols, and prolonged hospital stays play an important role. However, in recent years, inter-hospital patient movements between healthcare facilities have been recognized as an important route of transmission of pathogens between healthcare facilities. Various studies have used data on inter-hospital transfers of patients to construct healthcare networks. Based on those networks, various innovative infection control measures were proposed to contain the spread of HAIs [7–10]. Moreover, the burden of HAIs in a healthcare system has been proposed to be dependent on the structure of the inter-hospital network [9–12]. Similar to the role of inter-hospital patient movements, patient movements between the departments of a single hospital (intra-hospital movements) may contribute to spread of pathogens within a hospital. The effect of intra-hospital movements of patients on pathogen spread in a single hospital, however, is not fully understood. Various studies have reported the spread of MDR-E pathogens inside a hospital [13–17]. However, such studies were either limited to intensive care units (ICUs), or to some specific medical specialty departments, and patient movements between the departments were not assessed. Few modeling studies related to the spread of Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) [18,19] and Carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae  have evaluated the role of patient movements inside a hospital, but either very few departments were considered or departments other than ICUs were considered equal in terms of department structures (e.g. similar number of beds per department, similar movement rates between the departments etc.). These studies did not account for the hospital department network when investigating the role of intra-hospital patient movements. Certain departments such as ICUs, emergency and surgery departments tend to have more patient movements than others. Applying infection control strategies to those departments may, therefore, help to limit the spread of the pathogen. A detailed understanding of how patient movements inside a hospital contribute to the spread and prevalence of pathogens in departments and in the entire hospital may help to develop more effective infection control strategies."
PMC7873673,2021-02-10,Reconstructing the household transmission of influenza in the suburbs of Tokyo based on clinical cases," Influenza is a public health issue that needs to be addressed strategically. The assessment of detailed infectious profiles is an important part of this effort. Household transmission data play a key role in estimating such profiles. We used diagnostic and questionnaire-based data on influenza patients at a Japanese clinic to estimate the detailed infectious period (as well as incubation period, symptomatic and infectious periods, and extended infectious period after recovery) and the secondary attack ratio (SAR) of influenza for households of various sizes based on a modified Cauchemez-type model. RESULTS The data were from enrolled patients with confirmed influenza who were treated at the Hirotsu Clinic (Kawasaki, Japan) with a neuraminidase inhibitor (NAI) during six northern hemisphere influenza seasons between 2010 and 2016. A total of 2342 outpatients, representing 1807 households, were included. For influenza type A, the average incubation period was 1.43 days (95% probability interval, 0.03–5.32 days). The estimated average symptomatic and infective period was 1.76 days (0.33–4.62 days); the extended infective period after recovery was 0.25 days. The estimated SAR rose from 20 to 32% as household size increased from 3 to 5. For influenza type B, the average incubation period, average symptomatic and infective period, and extended infective period were estimated as 1.66 days (0.21–4.61), 2.62 days (0.54–5.75) and 1.00 days, respectively. The SAR increased from 12 to 21% as household size increased from 3 to 5. CONCLUSION All estimated periods of influenza type B were longer than the corresponding periods for type A. However, the SAR for type B was less than that for type A. These results may reflect Japanese demographics and treatment policy. Understanding the infectious profiles of influenza is necessary for assessing public health measures.","Simulation-based studies [1, 2] have been effectively used to assess the burden of influenza on society and the reaction of public health, as well as to help understand the dynamical nature of an epidemic . The household is considered a particularly useful artificial experimental environment in which all members of the family are expected to experience intense contact [4, 5]. The risk of infection attributed to infective individuals is directly reflected in the data as a series of infection events in a particular household, which is largely independent of other households based on the intense contact. Accordingly, household data have played a key role in addressing estimation problems and have received particular attention in the analysis of influenza infection. In a number of previous studies, a Reed & Frost-type model has been used to estimate the probability that one susceptible subject will experience at least one contact with one infected household subject per unit time [6, 7] using a chain binomial model. In this type of model, the parameters are essentially estimated based on the number of infected subjects at each point in time. As an alternative, Longini et al.  proposed a constructive way to estimate the probability of being infected by an infective household member or community from the final numbers at the end of the epidemic. Carrat et al.  conducted a longitudinal study of the household transmission of influenza in the 1999/2000 season that included the start and end times of the illness for 946 households. Cauchemez et al.  applied a Bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) to the outcome of the study to estimate the force of infection and the distribution of the infectious period simultaneously. Although the infective period is one of the most clinically important parameters to describe natural history, it alone is not sufficient to describe influenza epidemics. There have been numerous attempts to identify other parameters, both in Japan and elsewhere. Frequency of social contacts and the secondary attack ratio (SAR), which is the probability of any member (of n - 1) being infected by the primary source, in household contacts are also essential factors for describing epidemics, in addition to the infectious and latent periods. Wallinga et al.  quantified the concept of social contacts in an age-specific contact matrix, which was then applied by Mossong et al.  in an investigation in Europe. Carcione et al.  estimated the SAR in households during the first circulation of the pandemic influenza A(H1N1) 2009. In Japan, Uchida et al. [13–15] conducted questionnaire-based studies of school outbreaks. Takeuchi et al.  and Ibuka et al.  investigated social contacts in a village in Miyazaki prefecture and among age-stratified responders recruited online, respectively. Nishiura & Oshitani  estimated the SAR in households for the pandemic influenza A(H1N1) 2009."
PMC7872225,2021-01-28,Human T-cell lymphotropic virus type 1 transmission dynamics in rural villages in the Democratic Republic of the Congo with high nonhuman primate exposure,"The Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) has a history of nonhuman primate (NHP) consumption and exposure to simian retroviruses yet little is known about the extent of zoonotic simian retroviral infections in DRC. We examined the prevalence of human T-lymphotropic viruses (HTLV), a retrovirus group of simian origin, in a large population of persons with frequent NHP exposures and a history of simian foamy virus infection. We screened plasma from 3,051 persons living in rural villages in central DRC using HTLV EIA and western blot (WB). PCR amplification of HTLV tax and LTR sequences from buffy coat DNA was used to confirm infection and to measure proviral loads (pVLs). We used phylogenetic analyses of LTR sequences to infer evolutionary histories and potential transmission clusters. Questionnaire data was analyzed in conjunction with serological and molecular data. A relatively high proportion of the study population (5.4%, n = 165) were WB seropositive 128 HTLV-1-like, 3 HTLV-2-like, and 34 HTLV-positive but untypeable profiles. 85 persons had HTLV indeterminate WB profiles. HTLV seroreactivity was higher in females, wives, heads of households, and increased with age. HTLV-1 LTR sequences from 109 persons clustered strongly with HTLV-1 and STLV-1 subtype B from humans and simians from DRC, with most sequences more closely related to STLV-1 from Allenopithecus nigroviridis (Allen’s swamp monkey). While 18 potential transmission clusters were identified, most were in different households, villages, and health zones. Three HTLV-1-infected persons were co-infected with simian foamy virus. The mean and median percentage of HTLV-1 pVLs were 5.72% and 1.53%, respectively, but were not associated with age, NHP exposure, village, or gender. We document high HTLV prevalence in DRC likely originating from STLV-1. We demonstrate regional spread of HTLV-1 in DRC with pVLs reported to be associated with HTLV disease, supporting local and national public health measures to prevent spread and morbidity.","Human T-cell lymphotropic virus type 1 (HTLV-1), the first discovered human retrovirus, is widespread globally and can be highly oncogenic in some infected persons [1,2]. With increased human mobility and migration and limited communication regarding effective prevention strategies, HTLV-1 remains a significant public health threat [3, 4]. Furthermore, two new HTLV groups were discovered recently and their epidemiology is poorly understood [5–8]. Thus, a deeper understanding of the epidemiology of HTLV is increasingly important, with leading HTLV scientists and public health experts calling for renewed efforts to eradicate HTLV . In addition to HTLV-1, three other HTLV groups (types 2–4) have been identified, all four with varying geographic prevalence, disease potential, and evolutionary history [5, 9–12]. Globally, about 10–20 million people are estimated to be infected with HTLV-1, of which 2–7% progress to adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATLL) or HTLV-1 associated myelopathy/ tropical spastic paraparesis (HAM/TSP) [4, 13]. Although HTLV-1 can be found worldwide, its distribution is heavily clustered in specific populations [14, 15]. Of the seven described HTLV-1 subtypes, five (HTLV-1B, D, E, F, and G) are found primarily in Central Africa [2, 16]. HTLV-2 has also spread worldwide but is endemic in Amerindians and in persons who inject drugs. HTLV-2 has a lower pathogenicity than HTLV-1 but has been associated with various inflammatory diseases . HTLV-3 and -4 were identified more recently in West-Central Africa in nonhuman primate (NHP) hunters and the pathogenicity and transmission potential of these viruses is not yet well understood [8, 18–21]."
PMC7887718,2021-02-17,Clonal spread of multi-resistant Gallibacterium anatis isolates among Iranian broilers and layers,"Gallibacterium anatis is a common cause of reproductive tract infection in chickens, which leads to reduced egg production and increased mortality. This study was undertaken to investigate prevalence of G. anatis in 12 poultry flocks originating from Iranian provinces with leading chicken production and to determine genetic diversity, antimicrobial resistance, and the presence of major antigens of the isolates investigated. Out of the 120 chicken tracheal samples collected and tested, 84 (70%) were positive for G. anatis. Genotyping by Pulse Field Gel Electrophoresis and genome sequencing revealed a total of 24 pulsotypes for 71 strains (at a 87% similarity level) and seven genome clusters comprising 21 strains (97% similarity level), respectively. The combination of the two typing methods confirmed the presence of several genotypes originating from a common ancestor affecting poultry yet also suggested that identical clones were shared among chickens within farms and between different farms. The latter finding is to our knowledge the first example of clonal presence of G. anatis in epidemiologically unrelated farms. The 21 sequenced strains were characterized against a panel of commonly used antibiotics and showed lowered sensitivity to tetracycline (76.2%) and enrofloxacin (90.5%). The widespread presence of multiresistant G. anatis isolates calls for non-antibiotic prophylactics. Three major immunogen genes, gtxA, Gab_1309 and Gab_2312 were detected in the isolates indicating these antigens likely represent effective vaccine targets. A conserved sequence of the gtxA gene across a range of epidemiologically independent strains suggests the use of GtxA for future vaccine development purposes.","The human consumption of poultry meat and eggs has increased rapidly during the past century in Europe and the USA, and particularly in developing countries . In Iran, poultry production is among the most important economic activities and with a current production of over 2 million metric tons of chickens a year, it is among the 10 biggest producers of chickens in the world . Three types of chicken enterprises including broiler and layer production, and raising of replacement pullets predominate. Based on the Iranian Veterinary Organization report from 2019, there are about 449 million broilers and 107 million battery-cage layers in the country. Gallibacterium anatis is distributed globally as an important opportunistic pathogen in different poultry production systems . The bacterium has been reported in several countries within Europe (Switzerland, Denmark, Germany, Norway, England, Sweden, Czech Republic, Austria), Africa (Nigeria, Egypt, Morocco), Asia (China, Taiwan, Iran, Syria, India and Japan) and American countries (USA, Canada, Colombia, Peru and Mexico) . G. anatis is a Gram-negative, non-motile, encapsulated coccobacillus that constitutes part of the normal microbiota in the upper respiratory tracts and the lower genital tracts of healthy chickens . However G. anatis has also been associated with a wide range of lesions and reproductive tract disorders including salpingitis and peritonitis, and is thus considered a highly important opportunistic pathogen that can lead to lowered egg production and increased mortality . The mortality rate can be influenced by several factors such as poor hygiene, inadequate biosecurity measures and concurrent diseases with other poultry pathogens such as Escherichia coli . There is a growing concern about the emergence and spread of multidrug resistant strains of G. anatis, which have shown lowered sensitivity to a range of antimicrobials including sulpha drugs, novobiocin, tylosin, clindamycin, tetracycline and penicillin [7, 8]. Tetracycline resistance genes have previously been reported to be very common in a larger collection of G. anatis field strains from Mexico and Denmark . To counteract the negative effects of antimicrobially resistant G. anatis strains, efficient prophylactic measures appear to be the logical alternative to antibiotics to prevent and control G. anatis infections in poultry production systems. A pan-genomic reverse vaccinology (RV) approach has previously been applied to identify novel and potentially broadly protective immunogens from G. anatis that resulted in a selection of five proteins GtxA, FlfA, Gab_2156, Gab_1309 and Gab_2312 . Based on previous reports, particularly the RTX toxin, GtxA, has the potential to induce protective immunity against G. anatis challenge . GtxA is responsible for the hemolytic and leukotoxic properties of G. anatis and is considered the most important virulence factor of G. anatis . GtxA is composed of two domains, a C-terminal is responsible for hemolytic function and a N-terminal domain required for complete hemolytic activity . To allow colonization, G. anatis adheres to epithelial cells in avian hosts. The predominant adhesin belongs to the F17-like fimbrial family, which promotes adherence to host mucosal surfaces through binding to N-acetyl-d-glucosamine receptors . The fimbrial protein (FlfA) is very important for virulence in vivo and it was demonstrated that a flfA knockout mutant (∆flfA) is considerably attenuated in chickens . The remaining potential immunogens are less well characterized. Gab_1309 is a membrane protein related to metalloendopeptidases; Gab_2312 is an autotransporter adhesin and Gab_2156 is a F17-like fimbrial subunit ."
PMC7902662,2021-02-23,Scaling of contact networks for epidemic spreading in urban transit systems,"Improved mobility not only contributes to more intensive human activities but also facilitates the spread of communicable disease, thus constituting a major threat to billions of urban commuters. In this study, we present a multi-city investigation of communicable diseases percolating among metro travelers. We use smart card data from three megacities in China to construct individual-level contact networks, based on which the spread of disease is modeled and studied. We observe that, though differing in urban forms, network layouts, and mobility patterns, the metro systems of the three cities share similar contact network structures. This motivates us to develop a universal generation model that captures the distributions of the number of contacts as well as the contact duration among individual travelers. This model explains how the structural properties of the metro contact network are associated with the risk level of communicable diseases. Our results highlight the vulnerability of urban mass transit systems during disease outbreaks and suggest important planning and operation strategies for mitigating the risk of communicable diseases.","The rapid growth of population and activity intensity in megacities have propelled an evolutional shift of urban mobility from individual-centric travel to sustainable urban mobility. This substantial shift concerns environment, energy consumption, equity, among others1–4. Lying at heart for promoting sustainable travel is our understanding of the interplay among urban form, transportation system, and human mobility. Research across a diverse stream of studies and data sources have shown the scaling properties of individual mobility5–8 the vast majority of people travel between a few popular locations and their travel distances are bounded by the scale of the city and its transportation systems. One indispensable component of urban transportation is the mass transit system, which is so far the only sustainable solution to serve urban mobility needs on a large scale. In 2018, public mass transit served over 53 billion passengers worldwide. The three busiest metro systems reached the daily ridership of 9.48 million (Tokyo), 6.49 million (Moscow) and 5.6 million (Shanghai)9, respectively. While these systems allow a large number of commuters to travel efficiently, they also result in high population density within close proximity for long durations. These features establish an environment conducive to the spread of communicable diseases10–12. In particular, pathogens of infectious travelers can migrate to adjacent travelers through droplets and airborne transmissions, resulting in secondary infections during travel. Public mass transit and the underlying travel patterns are becoming an essential catalyst for influenza pandemics and may greatly accelerate the spreading pace of communicable diseases and thus increase the intensity of disease outbreaks in megacities. Despite acknowledging the linkage between human mobility and the spread of infectious disease8,13–18, current models do not understand the nexus on how the structure of physical contacts/encounters among individuals—which in turn enable the transmission of communicable diseases—are affected by the interaction between human mobility and physical infrastructures."
PMC7891744,2021-02-18,"Intimate partner violence by men living with HIV in Cameroon: Prevalence, associated factors and implications for HIV transmission risk (ANRS-12288 EVOLCAM)","OBJECTIVES Intimate partner violence (IPV) against women is frequent in Central Africa and may be a HIV infection risk factor. More data on HIV-positive men (MLHIV) committing IPV are needed to develop perpetrator-focused IPV and HIV prevention interventions. We investigated the relationship between IPV and HIV transmission risk and IPV-associated factors. METHODS We used data from the cross-sectional survey EVOLCam which was conducted in Cameroonian outpatient HIV structures in 2014. The study population comprised MLHIV declaring at least one sexual partner in the previous year. Using principal component analysis, we built three variables measuring, respectively, self-reported MLHIV-perpetrated psychological and physical IPV (PPV), severe physical IPV (SPV), and sexual IPV (SV). Ordinal logistic regressions helped investigate i) the relationship between HIV transmission risk (defined as unstable aviremia and inconsistent condom use) and IPV variables, ii) factors associated with each IPV variable. RESULTS PPV, SPV and SV were self-reported by 28, 15 and 11% of the 406 study participants, respectively. IPV perpetrators had a significantly higher risk of transmitting HIV than non-IPV perpetrators. Factors independently associated with IPV variables were i) socio-demographic, economic and dyadic factors, including younger age (PPV and SPV), lower income (PPV), not being the household head (SPV and SV), living with a main partner (SPV), and having a younger main partner (SPV); ii) sexual behaviors, including ≥2 partners in the previous year (PPV and SPV), lifetime sex with another man (SPV), inconsistent condom use (SV), and >20 partners during lifetime (SV); iii) HIV-related stigma (PPV and SV). CONCLUSION IPV perpetrators had a higher risk of transmitting HIV and having lifetime and recent risky sexual behaviors. Perpetrating IPV was more frequent in those with socioeconomic vulnerability and self-perceived HIV-related stigma. These findings highlight the need for interventions to prevent IPV by MLHIV and related HIV transmission to their(s) partner(s).","Intimate partner violence (IPV) affects two thirds of the population in Central Africa . Growing evidence suggests that, in certain contexts, IPV—including non-sexual IPV—increases the risk of HIV acquisition in women in heterosexual relationships through three main mechanisms [2–4]. First, men who are violent with female partners are more likely to acquire HIV from other partners, because of more frequent risky behaviors, including unprotected sex, transactional sex, and higher sexually transmitted infection (STI) incidences [5–9]. Second, women may have greater difficulty negotiating condom use or refusing to have sex with their partners . Coerced or undesired sex may also lead to more frequent anal intercourse  and anatomic lesions of the vaginal or rectal mucosa which increase the risk of HIV acquisition . Third, the psychological consequences of IPV on a victim may deteriorate immunity [5, 11], which is also a higher risk factor for HIV acquisition. In addition, being HIV infected may amplify existing psychological and social difficulties or generate new ones [6, 12–16], as the trauma of HIV diagnosis is compounded for those with prior traumatic stressors [17, 18]."
PMC7891758,2021-02-05,Endemicity of Paragonimus and paragonimiasis in Sub-Saharan Africa: A systematic review and mapping reveals stability of transmission in endemic foci for a multi-host parasite system,"Paragonimiasis is caused by zoonotic trematodes of Paragonimus spp., found in Asia, the Americas and Africa, particularly in tropical regions. These parasites have a complex, multi-host life cycle, with mammalian definitive hosts and larval stages cycling through two intermediate hosts (snails and freshwater decapod crustaceans). In Africa, paragonimiasis is particularly neglected, and remains the only human parasitic disease without a fully characterised life cycle. However paragonimiasis has potentially significant impacts on public health in Africa, and prevalence has likely been underestimated through under-reporting and misdiagnosis as tuberculosis due to a similar clinical presentation. We identified the need to synthesise current knowledge and map endemic foci for African Paragonimus spp. together with Poikilorchis congolensis, a rare, taxonomically distant trematode with a similar distribution and morphology. We present the first systematic review of the literature relating to African paragonimiasis, combined with mapping of all reported occurrences of Paragonimus spp. throughout Africa, from the 1910s to the present. In human surveys, numerous reports of significant recent transmission in Southeast Nigeria were uncovered, with high prevalence and intensity of infection. Overall prevalence was significantly higher for P. uterobilateralis compared to P. africanus across studies. The potential endemicity of P. africanus in Côte d’Ivoire is also reported. In freshwater crab intermediate hosts, differences in prevalence and intensity of either P. uterobilateralis or P. africanus were evident across genera and species, suggesting differences in susceptibility. Mapping showed temporal stability of endemic foci, with the majority of known occurrences of Paragonimus found in the rainforest zone of West and Central Africa, but with several outliers elsewhere on the continent. This suggests substantial under sampling and localised infection where potential host distributions overlap. Our review highlights the urgent need for increased sampling in active disease foci in Africa, particularly using molecular analysis to fully characterise Paragonimus species and their hosts.","Paragonimiasis is caused by food-borne zoonotic trematodes of Paragonimus spp., multi-host parasites whose complex life cycle includes a primary (or first intermediate) snail host; a secondary (or second intermediate) decapod crustacean host, and a mammalian definitive host. Human paragonimiasis has a global distribution in the Americas, Africa, and Asia, particularly in tropical regions [1,2]. An estimated 23 million people are infected worldwide, with the greatest disease burden in Asia [1–3]. The taxonomy of Paragonimus is problematic and in need of revision, but currently there are over 50 recognised species, 7 of which cause disease in humans [1,2]. Paragonimiasis in humans is generally caused by the consumption of incompletely cooked freshwater crabs that harbour the infective metacercarial larval stages of the parasite; but it can also be acquired by eating uncooked paratenic hosts, (such as cases from eating wild boar in Japan) which are infected with juvenile worms in development stasis [1,4]. Paragonimus is a euryxenous parasite with numerous mammalian reservoir hosts, including for example mongooses, civets, primates and domestic dogs and cats in Africa [5–8]. The parasite also develops in a broad range of molluscan first intermediate hosts, such as Rissooidea and Cerithioidea in Asia , and numerous crustacean second intermediate hosts, mostly species of brachyuran crab found in freshwater habitats, some of which are semi-terrestrial . In terms of the clinical picture, paragonimiasis is primarily a disease of the lungs, where adult worms lodge in lung tissue, although ectopic infections are relatively common in some Asian species . The main clinical symptoms include persistent cough, hemoptysis, and abdominal or chest pain . With often overlapping symptoms, there is the potential for diagnostic confusion with tuberculosis (TB); [3,11]. In Africa, paragonimiasis-like lung infections were first reported in the 1920s [12,13], and subsequently recorded only occasionally in the following 3 decades [14–18]. The first descriptions of African species of Paragonimus were published in 1965, for Paragonimus africanus  and Paragonimus uterobilateralis . Paragonimiasis in Africa came to widespread attention with an outbreak in Southeast Nigeria in the late 1960s, stemming from food shortages and concomitant consumption of freshwater crabs as a result of the Nigerian Civil war of 1967–1970 [19–21]. In more recent times, paragonimiasis in Africa has received remarkably little attention from the international research community, despite several recent studies reporting significant transmission within Nigeria in particular [22–27]; and also Cameroon [28,29]. Paragonimiasis in Africa remains the only human parasite without a fully characterised life cycle, with the first intermediate snail hosts of the African species of Paragonimus unconfirmed, and the miracidia, rediae and cercarial life stages undescribed. Suspected host snail species co-occurring in known crab host habitats include Achatinidae in Cameroon [30,31]; Potadoma freethii in Cameroon  and Nigeria [26,32]; Melania in Nigeria ; and P. sanctipauli, Afropomus balanoidea , and Homorus (Striosubulina) striateila (Achatinidae) in Liberia . The latter studies in Liberia attempted experimental infections, but the candidate Paragonimus-like cercariae failed to infect known freshwater crab hosts (Liberonautes) collected at the disease foci [34,36].

PMC7901226,2021-02-23,Extracellular vesicles from HTLV-1 infected cells modulate target cells and viral spread," The Human T-cell Lymphotropic Virus Type-1 (HTLV-1) is a blood-borne pathogen and etiological agent of Adult T-cell Leukemia/Lymphoma (ATLL) and HTLV-1 Associated Myelopathy/Tropical Spastic Paraparesis (HAM/TSP). HTLV-1 has currently infected up to 10 million globally with highly endemic areas in Japan, Africa, the Caribbean and South America. We have previously shown that Extracellular Vesicles (EVs) enhance HTLV-1 transmission by promoting cell–cell contact. RESULTS Here, we separated EVs into subpopulations using differential ultracentrifugation (DUC) at speeds of 2 k (2000×g), 10 k (10,000×g), and 100 k (100,000×g) from infected cell supernatants. Proteomic analysis revealed that EVs contain the highest viral/host protein abundance in the 2 k subpopulation (2 k > 10 k > 100 k). The 2 k and 10 k populations contained viral proteins (i.e., p19 and Tax), and autophagy proteins (i.e., LC3 and p62) suggesting presence of autophagosomes as well as core histones. Interestingly, the use of 2 k EVs in an angiogenesis assay (mesenchymal stem cells + endothelial cells) caused deterioration of vascular-like-tubules. Cells commonly associated with the neurovascular unit (i.e., astrocytes, neurons, and macrophages) in the blood–brain barrier (BBB) showed that HTLV-1 EVs may induce expression of cytokines involved in migration (i.e., IL-8; 100 k > 2 k > 10 k) from astrocytes and monocyte-derived macrophages (i.e., IL-8; 2 k > 10 k). Finally, we found that EVs were able to promote cell–cell contact and viral transmission in monocytic cell-derived dendritic cell. The EVs from both 2 k and 10 k increased HTLV-1 spread in a humanized mouse model, as evidenced by an increase in proviral DNA and RNA in the Blood, Lymph Node, and Spleen. CONCLUSIONS Altogether, these data suggest that various EV subpopulations induce cytokine expression, tissue damage, and viral spread.","The Human T-cell Lymphotropic Virus Type-1 (HTLV-1) is a bloodborne human retrovirus from the genus Deltaretrovirus . HTLV-1 infects 10 million globally with pockets of high endemicity in the Caribbean, South America, Western and Southern Africa, Iran, Japan, and Australia . HTLV-1 was first found in 1979 and published in 1980 [3, 4] and is the causative agent of an aggressive cancer known as Adult T-cell Leukemia/Lymphoma (ATLL) [5–7]. HTLV-1 also causes a set of progressive neuroinflammatory conditions known as HTLV-1-associated Myelopathy/Tropical Spastic Paraparesis (HAM/TSP) [8, 9]. HTLV-1 may cause ATLL in 3–5% of the infected population [7, 10–14], while causing HAM/TSP in 0.25–3.8% [15–17]. More recently, reports of 33.6% prevalence in a cohort of 1889 indigenous Australian patients  and the lack of global awareness about HTLV-1 are cause for public health concern . Despite the increased efforts to understand HTLV-1 pathogenicity, more research is needed to further understand how HTLV-1 persists, evades immunosurveillance, and proliferates in the central nervous system (CNS) and other organs throughout the body. The mode of HTLV-1 transmission, in contrast to that of the human immunodeficiency virus type-1 (HIV-1), is primarily via cell-to-cell contact involving mechanisms such as virological synapse (VS), viral biofilm (VB), cellular conduits (CCs) or tunneling nanotubes (TNTs) [20–23]. While cell-to-cell contact may limit HTLV-1 transmission rates, it also may allow the virus to remain undetected due to low numbers of free virions shown to be unstable and poorly infectious in monocytes, T-cells, and monocyte-derived dendritic cells [24–28]. The mechanisms of cell-to-cell transmission may involve peripheral and integral proteins which typically enable cellular communication and potentially viral transmission. For instance, the cluster of differentiation glycoproteins, CD45 and CD43, involved in migration, T-cell receptor signaling, and apoptosis , have been reported to be upregulated in HTLV-1 infection and may play a role in VB formation  and viral transmission . Similarly, the adhesion molecules ICAM-1 and LFA-1 have been shown to participate in VS transmission [21, 32–34]. Interestingly, our recent data has shown that these cellular proteins are upregulated not only in the HTLV-1 infected HUT102 cell line, but also in small membrane-bound structures, known as Extracellular Vesicles (EVs), as they are secreted by infected cells and contain CD45, CD43, ICAM-1 and LFA-1 ."
PMC7733613,2020-10-15,Genetic incompatibilities and reduced transmission in chickens may limit the evolution of reassortants between H9N2 and panzootic H5N8 clade 2.3.4.4 avian influenza virus showing high virulence for mammals,"The unprecedented spread of H5N8- and H9N2-subtype avian influenza virus (AIV) in birds across Asia, Europe, Africa, and North America poses a serious public health threat with a permanent risk of reassortment and the possible emergence of novel virus variants with high virulence in mammals. To gain information on this risk, we studied the potential for reassortment between two contemporary H9N2 and H5N8 viruses. While the replacement of the PB2, PA, and NS genes of highly pathogenic H5N8 by homologous segments from H9N2 produced infectious H5N8 progeny, PB1 and NP of H9N2 were not able to replace the respective segments from H5N8 due to residues outside the packaging region. Furthermore, exchange of the PB2, PA, and NS segments of H5N8 by those of H9N2 increased replication, polymerase activity and interferon antagonism of the H5N8 reassortants in human cells. Notably, H5N8 reassortants carrying the H9N2-subtype PB2 segment and to lesser extent the PA or NS segments showed remarkably increased virulence in mice as indicated by rapid onset of mortality, reduced mean time to death and increased body weight loss. Simultaneously, we observed that in chickens the H5N8 reassortants, particularly with the H9N2 NS segment, demonstrated significantly reduced transmission to co-housed chickens. Together, while the limited capacity for reassortment between co-circulating H9N2 and H5N8 viruses and the reduced bird-to-bird transmission of possible H5N8 reassortants in chickens may limit the evolution of such reassortant viruses, they show a higher replication potential in human cells and increased virulence in mammals.","Avian influenza viruses (AIV) are members of the genus influenza A virus (IAV) in the family Orthomyxoviridae. The single-stranded negative-sense RNA genome consists of eight segments, which encode at least 10 viral proteins (Bouvier and Palese 2008) divided into two categories structural (i.e. part of the virion) and non-structural components. The virion consists of the internal ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complex (encompassing polymerase basic subunit 1 (PB1) and subunit 2 (PB2), polymerase acidic protein (PA), nucleoprotein (NP), and viral RNA), the matrix protein 1 (M1), and the nuclear export protein (NEP). The virion envelope contains the hemagglutinin (HA), neuraminidase (NA), and matrix protein 2 (M2). Several non-structural proteins (e.g. NS1, PB1-F2, and PA-x) are not packaged into the virus particles, but are expressed in the host cell, and play important roles, for example, in interferon-antagonism, inflammatory response, or apoptosis. Some non-structural proteins are not necessarily present upon infection with every influenza virus (e.g. PB1-F2) (Bouvier and Palese 2008). The HA and NA of IAV are classified into 18 and 11 distinct subtypes, respectively (Bouvier and Palese 2008). H17, H18, N10, and N11 have not been found in avian species. The majority were identified in AIV from wild birds but also frequently isolated in poultry. While most of AIV exhibit low pathogenicity (LP) in the wild bird reservoir, AIV specifying H5 and H7 can become highly pathogenic (HP) after circulation of LP precursors in poultry (Alexander 2000). Due to the segmented nature of the viral genome, these segments can be exchanged (i.e. reassortment) between different viruses upon co-infection of the same host leading to the evolution of new virus variants with altered characteristics. Reassortment has resulted in strains that have caused pandemic outbreaks with devastating impacts on the human population (Mostafa et al. 2018).  H9N2 is the most widespread AIV subtype in poultry worldwide. Several clades of AIV H9N2 (e.g. G1, Y280, Korean or European lineages) are endemic in many countries in Asia, Europe and the Middle East (Fusaro et al. 2011). In poultry, some Asian H9N2 viruses exhibited mild-to-moderate virulence with or without co-infections with other viruses or bacteria (Guo et al. 2000; Kishida et al. 2004; Lee et al. 2011). Moreover, H9N2 viruses were isolated from humans in several countries (Freidl et al. 2014; Nagy, Mettenleiter, and Abdelwhab 2017). Importantly, H9N2 viruses donated internal segments to other AIV generating zoonotic reassortant viruses, like AIV A/Goose/Guangdong/1/1996 H5N1 (GsGD96) (Guan et al. 1999), the 2013 H10N8 (Chen et al. 2014), and the continuously circulating 2013 H7N9 (Pu et al. 2015)."

Here we report that amoebae-release respirable-sized vesicles containing high concentrations of infectious RSV that persisted for the duration of the experiment. Given the ubiquity of amoebae in moist environments, our results suggest that extracellular amoebal-vesicles could contribute to the environmental persistence of respiratory viruses, including potential resistance to disinfection processes and thereby offering novel pathways for viral dissemination and transmission.","The virus used in this study was green fluorescent protein-expressing RSV (GFP-RSV) containing the viral glycoproteins (S, G and F)47. The RSV was propagated on 80–90% confluent HeLa cells (ATCC CCL-2) in DMEM medium containing 10% FBS, and 1% penicillin-streptomycin at 37 °C and 5% CO2 in vented 75 cm2 cell-culture flasks. The amoebae used in this study was Willaertia magna (ATCC 50035), a member of the Vahlkampfiidae family that was isolated from bovine faeces.

PMC8024054,2020-10-14,A Quantitative Framework for Defining the End of an Infectious Disease Outbreak: Application to Ebola Virus Disease,"The end-of-outbreak declaration is an important step in controlling infectious disease outbreaks. Objective estimation of the confidence level that an outbreak is over is important to reduce the risk of postdeclaration flare-ups. We developed a simulation-based model with which to quantify that confidence and tested it on simulated Ebola virus disease data. We found that these confidence estimates were most sensitive to the instantaneous reproduction number, the reporting rate, and the time between the symptom onset and death or recovery of the last detected case. For Ebola virus disease, our results suggested that the current World Health Organization criterion of 42 days since the recovery or death of the last detected case is too short and too sensitive to underreporting. Therefore, we suggest a shift to a preliminary end-of-outbreak declaration after 63 days from the symptom onset day of the last detected case. This preliminary declaration should still be followed by 90 days of enhanced surveillance to capture potential flare-ups of cases, after which the official end of the outbreak can be declared. This sequence corresponds to more than 95% confidence that an outbreak is over in most of the scenarios examined. Our framework is generic and therefore could be adapted to estimate end-of-outbreak confidence for other infectious diseases.","

 Declaring the end of an outbreak is a critical programmatic step in outbreak response. Any infectious disease outbreak can be devastating for affected populations and areas. The outbreak status of a region or a country can influence other vital sectors, such as the social, economic, political, and security sectors (1–3). In defining the end of an outbreak, it is crucial to consider the risk of cases’ arising in the future using objective quantitative methods. A well-timed end-of-outbreak declaration is essential. It allows affected countries to address problems in other sectors, reallocate health-care resources to cover other important public health issues, and start postoutbreak recovery efforts."
PMC8048528,2019-12-01,Spatiotemporal reconstruction and transmission dynamics during the 2016–17 H5N8 highly pathogenic avian influenza epidemic in Italy,"Effective control of avian diseases in domestic populations requires understanding of the transmission dynamics facilitating viral emergence and spread. In 2016–17, Italy experienced a significant avian influenza epidemic caused by a highly pathogenic A(H5N8) virus, which affected domestic premises housing around 2.7 million birds, primarily in the north‐eastern regions with the highest density of poultry farms (Lombardy, Emilia‐Romagna and Veneto). We perform integrated analyses of genetic, spatiotemporal and host data within a Bayesian phylogenetic framework. Using continuous and discrete phylogeography, we estimate the locations of movements responsible for the spread and persistence of the epidemic. The information derived from these analyses on rates of transmission between regions through time can be used to assess the success of control measures. Using an approach based on phylogenetic–temporal distances between domestic cases, we infer the presence of cryptic wild bird‐mediated transmission, information that can be used to complement existing epidemiological methods for distinguishing transmission within the domestic population from incursions across the wildlife–domestic interface, a common challenge in veterinary epidemiology. Spatiotemporal reconstruction of the epidemic reveals a highly skewed distribution of virus movements with a high proportion of shorter distance local movements interspersed with occasional long‐distance dispersal events associated with wild birds. We also show how such inference be used to identify possible instances of human‐mediated movements where distances between phylogenetically linked domestic cases are unusually high.","In 2016–17, a highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) epidemic caused by A(H5N8) viruses of clade 2.3.4.4 occurred in 29 European Countries. This was the largest HPAI epidemic ever recorded in Europe in terms of number of poultry outbreaks, wild bird deaths recorded and geographical extent (Adlhoch et al., 2018; Brown, Kuiken, et al., 2017; Brown, Mulatti, et al., 2017). Between October 2016 and December 2017, approximately 1,500 cases were identified in wild birds and more than 1,200 outbreaks were reported in poultry across Europe, with frequent primary incursions affecting all productive sectors, ranging from backyard/rural to industrial. Secondary spread between domestic premises was also detected, most commonly associated with domestic waterfowl species (Brown, Kuiken, et al., 2017; Brown, Mulatti, et al., 2017). The first HPAI cases in Italy were identified in late December 2016 with two A(H5N8) and two A(H5N5) HPAI viruses confirmed in dead wild birds found in north‐eastern Italy between 30 December 2016 and 23 January 2017 (Fusaro et al., 2017). While H5N5 subtype viruses were not further detected, A(H5N8) HPAI spread widely in northern Italy leading to several cases in both domestic poultry and wild birds (Fusaro et al., 2017). In contrast to the rest of Europe, Italy experienced two distinct epidemic waves during 2016–2017 which presented different characteristics (Mulatti et al., 2018). The first wave which comprised 16 cases confirmed in poultry and five in wild birds (excluding two A(H5N5) cases) started in late December 2016 and continued until late May 2017 following an atypical epidemic curve, with sporadic weekly reported cases and a limited involvement of wild birds in discordance with observations in other European Countries (Globig et al., 2017; Mulatti et al., 2018; Verhagen et al., 2017). Most cases were detected at the periphery of the most densely populated poultry area (DPPA) in the northern Italian regions of Veneto, Lombardy and Emilia‐Romagna. The second epidemic wave started in the second half of July 2017 and ended by mid‐December of the same year (Brown, Kuiken, et al., 2017; Mulatti et al., 2018). Sixty‐seven outbreaks were observed in poultry farms, mainly fattening turkey premises, while only seven cases were confirmed in wild birds. During the second wave, the virus spread to the DPPA in the Po Valley, where most of the cases were located. Sporadic, isolated outbreaks were also notified in Piedmont, and Lazio, in western and central Italy, respectively. The second epidemic wave presented a classic occurrence pattern for an infectious disease spreading in a densely populated area, with evidence of lateral spread leading to clusters of interconnected outbreaks (Mulatti et al., 2018)."
PMC8049625,2021-04-15,Dynamics of a new HIV model with the activation status of infected cells,"The activation status can dictate the fate of an HIV-infected CD4+ T cell. Infected cells with a low level of activation remain latent and do not produce virus, while cells with a higher level of activation are more productive and thus likely to transfer more virions to uninfected cells during cell-to-cell transmission. How the activation status of infected cells affects HIV dynamics under antiretroviral therapy remains unclear. We develop a new mathematical model that structures the population of infected cells continuously according to their activation status. The effectiveness of antiretroviral drugs in blocking cell-to-cell viral transmission decreases as the level of activation of infected cells increases because the more virions are transferred from infected to uninfected cells during cell-to-cell transmission, the less effectively the treatment is able to inhibit the transmission. The basic reproduction number [Formula see text] of the model is shown to determine the existence and stability of the equilibria. Using the principal spectral theory and comparison principle, we show that the infection-free equilibrium is locally and globally asymptotically stable when [Formula see text] is less than one. By constructing Lyapunov functional, we prove that the infected equilibrium is globally asymptotically stable when [Formula see text] is greater than one. Numerical investigation shows that even when treatment can completely block cell-free virus infection, virus can still persist due to cell-to-cell transmission. The random switch between infected cells with different activation levels can also contribute to the replenishment of the latent reservoir, which is considered as a major barrier to viral eradication. This study provides a new modeling framework to study the observations, such as the low viral load persistence, extremely slow decay of latently infected cells and transient viral load measurements above the detection limit, in HIV-infected patients during suppressive antiretroviral therapy.","Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is the pathogenic agent of the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). It infects CD4+ T cells, an important component of the immune system, leading to patient death eventually caused by opportunistic infection. According to the World Health Organization, there were approximately 36.9 million people living with HIV by the end of 2017 (WHO 2018). It was estimated that about 25% of people infected with HIV did not know their infection status (WHO 2018). There has been constant interest in the study of HIV infection dynamics, mechanisms for disease progression, antiretroviral treatment and vaccine development. Mathematical models have been increasingly used to study these issues (Perelson and Ribeiro 2013). Perelson et al.  used a basic viral dynamic model to study the interaction between viruses and host CD4+ T cells. An extension of this model including a secondary source of viral production such as activation of latently infected cells was proposed to explain the second-phase viral load decline after administration of antiretroviral drug combination (Perelson et al. 1997). Latently infected cells can escape antiretroviral drug treatment and immune surveillance. They do not produce virus unless they are activated by relevant antigens. Multiple cellular and molecular mechanisms might be involved in the establishment of HIV latency (Donahue and Wainberg 2013). For example, the HIV transactivator of transcription (Tat) protein plays an essential role in viral transcription regulation, and may affect the formulation and reversal of HIV latency (Jordan et al. 2001; Lin et al. 2003). Weinberger et al.  showed that cells with intermediate Tat concentrations could be driven by stochastic fluctuations to either revert to the latent status or turn to highly activated and productive status. Wang and Rong  developed a mathematical model that includes such stochastic population switch, and showed that the model can explain the stability of the latent reservoir (i.e. a group of latently infected CD4+ T cells) and emergence of viral blips (i.e. transient viral load measurements above the detection limit). However, the status of the activation of infected cells (or the level of Tat concentration) can be continuous, more than the three levels (low, intermediate and high) studied in Wang and Rong . In this paper, we include continuous activation status of infected cells in models to study the virus dynamics of HIV infection under antiretroviral therapy."
PMC7549798,2020-09-21,Fast estimation of time-varying infectious disease transmission rates,"Compartmental epidemic models have been used extensively to study the historical spread of infectious diseases and to inform strategies for future control. A critical parameter of any such model is the transmission rate. Temporal variation in the transmission rate has a profound influence on disease spread. For this reason, estimation of time-varying transmission rates is an important step in identifying mechanisms that underlie patterns in observed disease incidence and mortality. Here, we present and test fast methods for reconstructing transmission rates from time series of reported incidence. Using simulated data, we quantify the sensitivity of these methods to parameters of the data-generating process and to mis-specification of input parameters by the user. We show that sensitivity to the user’s estimate of the initial number of susceptible individuals—considered to be a major limitation of similar methods—can be eliminated by an efficient, “peak-to-peak” iterative technique, which we propose. The method of transmission rate estimation that we advocate is extremely fast, for even the longest infectious disease time series that exist. It can be used independently or as a fast way to obtain better starting conditions for computationally expensive methods, such as iterated filtering and generalized profiling.","The transmission rate of an infectious disease is a salient quantity in the study of epidemics. Changes in the transmission rate over time greatly influence the spread of infection [1, 2]. Quantifying how it changes over time can elucidate factors governing disease spread (e.g., weather , contact patterns ), inform epidemic forecasts, and suggest strategies for epidemic control . In practice, we do not observe transmission directly. Instead, we observe the number of cases of infection (disease incidence) or number of deaths from infection (disease mortality) reported over time, and must reconstruct time-varying transmission rates from these data [6–13]. Utilizing historical mortality records, it is possible to identify patterns in transmission dating far back in time. Most notably, the London Bills of Mortality and the Registrar General’s Weekly Returns enable investigation of transmission patterns continuously from the mid-17th century to the present, for a number of infectious diseases including cholera  and smallpox ."
PMC7837477,2021-01-26,Repurposing the orphan drug nitisinone to control the transmission of African trypanosomiasis,"Tsetse transmit African trypanosomiasis, which is a disease fatal to both humans and animals. A vaccine to protect against this disease does not exist so transmission control relies on eliminating tsetse populations. Although neurotoxic insecticides are the gold standard for insect control, they negatively impact the environment and reduce populations of insect pollinator species. Here we present a promising, environment-friendly alternative to current insecticides that targets the insect tyrosine metabolism pathway. A bloodmeal contains high levels of tyrosine, which is toxic to haematophagous insects if it is not degraded and eliminated. RNA interference (RNAi) of either the first two enzymes in the tyrosine degradation pathway (tyrosine aminotransferase (TAT) and 4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate dioxygenase (HPPD)) was lethal to tsetse. Furthermore, nitisinone (NTBC), an FDA-approved tyrosine catabolism inhibitor, killed tsetse regardless if the drug was orally or topically applied. However, oral administration of NTBC to bumblebees did not affect their survival. Using a novel mathematical model, we show that NTBC could reduce the transmission of African trypanosomiasis in sub-Saharan Africa, thus accelerating current disease elimination programmes.","Human African trypanosomiasis (HAT), also known as sleeping sickness, is a parasitic disease caused predominantly by the parasite Trypanosoma brucei gambiense. These parasites are transmitted to a vertebrate host when infected tsetse flies (Glossina spp.) blood feed. HAT currently affects 3,500 people/year; most patients live in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and an estimated 70 million people remain at risk of infection in sub-Saharan Africa . Tsetse also spread animal African trypanosomiasis (AAT), which causes high mortality rates in livestock and consequently severely limits animal production . As no vaccine for either HAT or AAT exist, and drug treatments are often difficult to obtain, tsetse population control remains essential to limit the spread of trypanosomiasis. In the last decades, tsetse control tools such as aerial spraying of insecticides (pyrethroids), visual- and odour-baited tsetse traps, insecticide-treated livestock, live traps, insecticide-impregnated traps and targets, and sterile male releases have been employed [3–7]. Despite such efforts, because AAT and HAT persist in these endemic areas, both economic development and public health continue to be jeopardised . Consequently, a novel complementary strategy to control these parasitic diseases is highly desired. Tsetse, like other blood-feeding arthropods, ingest large quantities of blood and often exceed twice their body weight in a single meal . Since more than 85% of blood dry weight consists of proteins, large quantities of amino acids are released in the midgut during bloodmeal digestion . Previously, we showed that blocking tyrosine catabolism after a bloodmeal is lethal in mosquitoes, ticks, and kissing bugs due to the accumulation of toxic quantities of tyrosine . However, inhibiting tyrosine catabolism in non-blood-feeding insects is harmless, which further provides evidence for the essentiality of this pathway for haematophagy . In the present work, we evaluated how tsetse physiology was controlled by two enzymes in the tyrosine catabolism pathway tyrosine aminotransferase (TAT) and 4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate dioxygenase (HPPD). The drug nitisinone (2-(2-nitro-4-trifluoromethylbenzoyl)-1,3cyclohexanedione; NTBC), also known as Orfadin, is an HPPD inhibitor currently used to treat patients with the genetic disease hypertyrosinemia type I (HT-1) , and is under clinical evaluation for the treatment of alkaptonuria . NTBC was lethal to blood-fed tsetse flies. NTBC treatment, either administered orally as an endectocide or topically to the insect cuticle, causes the accumulation of tyrosine and 4-hydroxyphenyl lactic acid (HPLA) metabolites, which leads to initial fly paralysis followed by tissue destruction within 18 hours of the bloodmeal. Our results provide evidence that NTBC could be used as an eco-friendly synergistic strategy alongside current tsetse control practices."

Constructing the transmission model of SFTS could help provide clues for disease control and fill the gap in research on SFTS models. METHODS We built an SFTS transmission dynamics model based on the susceptible–exposed–infectious–asymptomatic–recovered (SEIAR) model and the epidemiological characteristics of SFTS in Jiangsu Province. This model was used to evaluate the effect by cutting off different transmission routes and taking different interventions into account, to offer clues for disease prevention and control. RESULTS The transmission model fits the reported data well with a minimum R value of 0.29 and a maximum value of 0.80, P < 0.05. Meanwhile, cutting off the environmental transmission route had the greatest effect on the prevention and control of SFTS, while isolation and shortening the course of the disease did not have much effect. CONCLUSIONS The model we have built can be used to simulate the transmission of SFTS to help inform disease control. It is noteworthy that cutting off the environment-to-humans transmission route in the model had the greatest effect on SFTS prevention and control.

The clinical course is mainly divided into three stages fever, multiple nerve dysfunction and recovery [1, 3, 4, 3, 7]. In previous years, SFTS occurred mainly in the rural areas of central and northeast China, with an estimated 500–1500 cases recorded in 2011–2012. Over time, SFTS has spread to South Korea and Japan, although the related fatality rate of nearly 30% has dropped to 10–12% in recent years . In South Korea, the fatality rate was above 35% among infected patients in 2012–2013, but the incidence rate dropped to 11.52% in 2016 . In Japan, however, the fatality rate is slightly higher than that observed in China (23%), and cases have mainly occurred in the western regions . Currently, the SFTS fatality rate in Asia seems to be decreasing, while the incidence rate is increasing regionally, especially in China. According to the monitoring data from the China Information Network System of Disease Prevention and Control, SFTS incidence and prevalence rates have increased each year from 2010 to 2016, with cases found in 23 provinces . Analyzing the epidemiological characteristics of SFTS, one published study found Henan Province, Hubei Province and Anhui Province to be the main provinces with the largest numbers of cases before 2011 . Including five other provinces, SFTS cases were detected in Jiangsu Province as far back as 2011 .

We investigate the spatial heterogeneity of the outbreak among districts in Sierra Leone. The stochastic discrete-time susceptible-exposed-infectious-removed (SEIR) model is used, allowing for probabilistic movements from one compartment to another. Our model accounts for heterogeneity among districts by making use of a hierarchical approach. The transmission rates are considered time-varying. It is investigated whether or not incubation period, infectious period and transmission rates are different among districts. Estimation is done using the Bayesian formalism. The posterior estimates of the effective reproductive number were substantially different across the districts, with pronounced variability in districts with few cases of Ebola. The posterior estimates of the reproductive number at the district level varied between below 1.0 and 4.5, whereas at nationwide level it varied between below 1.0 and 2.5. The posterior estimate of the effective reproductive number reached a value below 1.0 around December. In some districts, the effective reproductive number pointed out for the persistence of the outbreak or for a likely resurgence of new cases of Ebola virus disease (EVD). The posterior estimates have shown to be highly sensitive to prior elicitation, mainly the incubation period and infectious period.","Ebola, also known as Ebola hemorrhagic fever, is a rare and deadly disease caused by an infection of one of the Ebola virus strains. Ebola can cause diseases in humans and nonhuman primates (monkeys, gorillas, and chimpanzees) . EVD is mainly transmitted through direct contact with infected bodily fluids and contaminated materials. At the early stage, the disease is characterized by initial-flu symptoms, high fever, severe headache followed by pharyngitis and abdominal pain, whereas the late stage of the disease is marked by vomiting, diarrhea, rash, and internal and external bleeding . The disease was first identified in Sudan and Zaire in 1976 where it infected over 284 people with a mortality rate of 53%, and subsequently, few months later after the first outbreak, another outbreak emerged in Yambuku, Zaire, affecting 315 and killing 254 people . In March 2014, a major Ebola outbreak emerged in Guinea, being declared by the World Health Organization as the largest ever documented outbreak in western African region. Later, the disease propagated to Liberia, Sierra Leone and Nigeria, and as of May it was reported that 27,443 people contracted the disease and about 11,207 died from EVD . Furthermore, it is also reported that among all countries, Sierra Leone was the worst affected country, with 13,534 confirmed, probable, and suspected cases, as of 23rd May 2014 . In light of this scenario, the government of Sierra Leone declared a State of Emergency on 6 August 2014 which was followed by 3 day nationwide quarantine on 19-21 September 2014 . The EVD not only forced restricted measures in Sierra Leone, but also urged the World Health Organization to declare the Ebola outbreak as an international public health problem of extreme emergency, turning it into a worldwide problem [4, 7]."
PMC8138384,2021-02-27,Viral load could be an important determinant for fomites based transmission of viral infections," AND OBJECTIVE Fomites are common sources of transmission of certain infections. Infectious pathogens, such as viruses known to cause respiratory tract infections, are common examples of being transmitted by fomites. However, the load of the particular pathogen on these inanimate surfaces is a crucial factor for the transmission. The current study aims at investigating the load of one such viral pathogen on the surfaces of commonly used materials. METHODS Based on the cycle threshold (Ct) values in the diagnostic system using gene amplification for the considered viral pathogen, we categorized the positive samples for high (17 to < 24), moderate (24 to < 31), or mild (31 to < 38) viral load. Five randomly selected samples from each of these category were smeared on commonly used cardboard surface (absorbent surface) and stainless steel (non-absorbent surface). After an observation duration of 90 min, samples from the surfaces were analyzed again for gene amplification using RT-PCR. RESULTS Viral load/titter positively correlated with the viral material on either of these investigated surfaces post-observation duration. Higher viral load (low Ct) samples exhibited higher probability of being detected on the surfaces than those samples with lower/moderate (high Ct) viral load. INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSION Common inanimate surfaces are potential source of the viral transmission, however the viral load on these surfaces are key determinant of such transmission.","Viral pathogens are responsible for the majority of infectious diseases among humans and respiratory infections account for majority of them. Microbial risk assessment of the viral pathogen is well-recognized entity in the transmission dynamics of infectious diseases. Some of the viral respiratory infectious diseases, that were previously regarded to be transmitted by direct contact with the aerosols produced by the cough/sneeze of infected individual, are significantly being transmitted via inanimate/fomite surfaces. Viral respiratory pathogens such as influenza, rhinovirus, and coronavirus are well documented for their potential fomite based transmission."
PMC8140568,2021-05-22,The effect of community-driven larval source management and house improvement on malaria transmission when added to the standard malaria control strategies in Malawi: a cluster-randomized controlled trial," Current standard interventions are not universally sufficient for malaria elimination. The effects of community-based house improvement (HI) and larval source management (LSM) as supplementary interventions to the Malawi National Malaria Control Programme (NMCP) interventions were assessed in the context of an intensive community engagement programme. METHODS The study was a two-by-two factorial, cluster-randomized controlled trial in Malawi. Village clusters were randomly assigned to four arms a control arm; HI; LSM; and HI + LSM. Malawi NMCP interventions and community engagement were used in all arms. Household-level, cross-sectional surveys were conducted on a rolling, 2-monthly basis to measure parasitological and entomological outcomes over 3 years, beginning with one baseline year. The primary outcome was the entomological inoculation rate (EIR). Secondary outcomes included mosquito density, Plasmodium falciparum prevalence, and haemoglobin levels. All outcomes were assessed based on intention to treat, and comparisons between trial arms were conducted at both cluster and household level. RESULTS Eighteen clusters derived from 53 villages with 4558 households and 20,013 people were randomly assigned to the four trial arms. The mean nightly EIR fell from 0.010 infectious bites per person (95% CI 0.006–0.015) in the baseline year to 0.001 (0.000, 0.003) in the last year of the trial. Over the full trial period, the EIR did not differ between the four trial arms (p = 0.33). Similar results were observed for the other outcomes mosquito density and P. falciparum prevalence decreased over 3 years of sampling, while haemoglobin levels increased; and there were minimal differences between the trial arms during the trial period. CONCLUSIONS In the context of high insecticide-treated bed net use, neither community-based HI, LSM, nor HI + LSM contributed to further reductions in malaria transmission or prevalence beyond the reductions observed over two years across all four trial arms. This was the first trial, as far as the authors are aware, to test the potential complementary impact of LSM and/or HI beyond levels achieved by standard interventions. The unexpectedly low EIR values following intervention implementation indicated a promising reduction in malaria transmission for the area, but also limited the usefulness of this outcome for measuring differences in malaria transmission among the trial arms.

In Africa, where 92% of malaria cases occur, this reduction was largely attributed to vector control with insecticide-treated bed nets (ITNs) and indoor residual spraying (IRS), and treatment with artemisinin-based combination therapy . Yet progress in malaria control stalled in the period 2015–2017, with an estimated 219 million malaria cases occurring worldwide annually . There are multiple, overlapping challenges limiting the ability of the current malaria interventions to continue reducing malaria burden at the rate observed from 2000 to 2015, including insecticide resistance , drug resistance , barriers to achieving target access, use, acceptability and sustainability , and residual malaria transmission . Due to these well documented challenges, the need for additional malaria interventions is widely recognized . In most cases, it is envisaged that additional interventions need to be deployed alongside existing core interventions, potentially leading to additive or synergistic effects beyond that of the core interventions on their own. Two vector control interventions that could provide additional protection from malaria when integrated into standard national control programmes are house improvement (HI) and larval source management (LSM) ."
PMC8150629,2021-05-26,"Widespread Prevalence of Antibodies Against Swine Influenza A (pdm H1N1 09) Virus in Pigs of Eastern Uttar Pradesh, India","Swine influenza virus (SIV) belongs to family Orthomyxoviridae and can cause acute respiratory infection in pigs. Several pandemic H1N1 human fatal influenza cases were reported in India. Though pigs are predisposed to both avian and human influenza virus infections with the potential to generate novel reassortants, there are only a few reports of SIV in Indian pigs. We conducted a serological survey to assess the status of H1N1 infection in pigs of various states in India, between 2009 and 2016. Based on Haemagglutination inhibition (HI) assay, seroprevalence rate of H1N1 virus ranged between 5.2%  and 36.3% . Widespread prevalence of antibody was observed in eastern Uttar Pradesh from 6.2 to 37.5% during the study period. Co-circulation of seasonal H1N1 virus along with pandemic H1N1 virus was indicated by the presence of specific antibodies against seasonal H1N1 virus in eastern part of Uttar Pradesh. Seroprevalence rate in pigs and influenza infection trend in human shows the possible spill over transmission of influenza to pigs from human. Hence, besides serological surveillance, continuous and systematic molecular surveillance should be implemented in pig population to reduce/quantify the risk and emergence of pandemic influenza.","In early April 2009, there was an outbreak of H1N1 influenza A detected in Mexico , spreading to many countries. It was declared as pandemic influenza by World Health Organization (WHO) in June 2009 . Since 2009, pandemic influenza H1N1 has been also reported in various states of India . Pig plays an important role in epidemiology and transmission of influenza virus due the presence of sialic acid (SA) linked to galactose (Gal) by α-2,3 linkage (SA α-2,3-Gal) and α-2,6 receptors (SA α-2,6-Gal) for both avian and mammalian influenza viruses, respectively [4, 5]. The assessment of antibodies for swine influenza in pigs is needed due to its susceptibility to both avian and mammalian influenza viruses and its involvement in interspecies transmission . Swine influenza is an acute respiratory infection with production losses in pig population that is reported worldwide. The disease is caused by type A influenza virus, belonging to family Orthomyxoviridae, genus Influenza virus [7, 8]. Besides morbidity and production losses, maintenance and evolution of influenza viruses in pigs pose obvious public health risk. There are reports of circulation of classical swine H1N1 viruses in pigs for at least 84 years . The emergence of novel influenza viruses with pandemic potential to human population is known to be mediated by antigenic shift in domestic pigs (as a mixing vessel) . All three pandemics of the previous century were believed to originate from reassortment events in either pigs or humans. Co-circulation and mixing of the triple reassortant H3N2 with swine lineage and emergence of pandemic swine origin influenza virus is reported since 2009 [11–14]. Transmission of 2009 pandemic H1N1 virus from humans to pigs (reverse zoonosis) has also been reported in many countries, including India [15–20]. Hence, monitoring of pig population is essential to predict the status and epidemiology of influenza in humans."
PMC8137918,2021-05-20,TNF controls a speed-accuracy tradeoff in the cell death decision to restrict viral spread,"Rapid death of infected cells is an important antiviral strategy. However, fast decisions that are based on limited evidence can be erroneous and cause unnecessary cell death and subsequent tissue damage. How cells optimize their death decision making strategy to maximize both speed and accuracy is unclear. Here, we show that exposure to TNF, which is secreted by macrophages during viral infection, causes cells to change their decision strategy from “slow and accurate” to “fast and error-prone”. Mathematical modeling combined with experiments in cell culture and whole organ culture show that the regulation of the cell death decision strategy is critical to prevent HSV-1 spread. These findings demonstrate that immune regulation of cellular cognitive processes dynamically changes a tissues’ tolerance for self-damage, which is required to protect against viral spread.","Rapid detection of viral infection is needed to minimize spread and associated damage. At the same time, evolutionary pressures constantly enhance the arsenal of strategies that viruses use to evade and manipulate host detection1,2. The adversarial co-evolution between host detection and viral avoidance creates a challenging and time-dependent classification problem for host cells that likely operate close to the detection limits imposed by the inherent stochasticity of biochemical reactions. Rapid decision making at the noise limit is likely to result in false-positive classification i.e., a decision that a virus is there when it is not, followed by unnecessary cell death and bystander tissue damage. How cells navigate the tradeoff between decision speed and accuracy to achieve an optimal classification strategy has not been explored. The initial detection of viral invasion in a tissue is accomplished by macrophages and other innate immune sentinels3. These specialized cells secrete cytokines and other inflammatory mediators to alert nearby cells of invading pathogens. Alerted cells then execute diverse strategies to prevent viral spread including restriction of viral entry, direct inhibition of viral gene expression, prevention of viral genome replication, prevention of viral egress, and death of infected cells4,5. These defense mechanisms are activated in an inducible manner as they have the potential to interfere with normal host cell physiology6–9. We asked how cells balance the competing goals of antiviral activity and maintenance of normal physiology in response to macrophage-derived inflammatory cytokines. We focused on Tumor Necrosis Factor ɑ (TNF), because it is an important antiviral cytokine10, yet can also cause significant damage to healthy host tissues due to its role regulating cell death pathways11. This relationship is exemplified by the observation that TNF-blocking drugs have shown remarkable success for treatment of autoimmune disorders, yet also increase susceptibility to certain pathogens12. Further, excessive production of TNF has been implicated as an important driver of cell death and tissue destruction during infection with hyper-virulent virus strains such as the H5N1 and 1918 pandemic influenza subtypes6–8."
PMC8200794,2021-06-14,"Three transmission events of Vibrio cholerae O1 into Lusaka, Zambia"," Cholera has been present and recurring in Zambia since 1977. However, there is a paucity of data on genetic relatedness and diversity of the Vibrio cholerae isolates responsible for these outbreaks. Understanding whether the outbreaks are seeded from existing local isolates or if the outbreaks represent separate transmission events can inform public health decisions. RESULTS Seventy-two V. cholerae isolates from outbreaks in 2009/2010, 2016, and 2017/2018 in Zambia were characterized using multilocus variable number tandem repeat analysis (MLVA) and whole genome sequencing (WGS). The isolates had eight distinct MLVA genotypes that clustered into three MLVA clonal complexes (CCs). Each CC contained isolates from only one outbreak. The results from WGS revealed both clustered and dispersed single nucleotide variants. The genetic relatedness of isolates based on WGS was consistent with the MLVA, each CC was a distinct genetic lineage and had nearest neighbors from other East African countries. In Lusaka, isolates from the same outbreak were more closely related to themselves and isolates from other countries than to isolates from other outbreaks in other years. CONCLUSIONS Our observations are consistent with i) the presence of random mutation and alternative mechanisms of nucleotide variation, and ii) three separate transmission events of V. cholerae into Lusaka, Zambia. We suggest that locally, case-area targeted invention strategies and regionally, well-coordinated plans be in place to effectively control future cholera outbreaks. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION The online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1186/s12879-021-06259-5.","Cholera has been present and recurring in Zambia since 1977 . In Zambia and in most sub-Saharan countries, cholera is diagnosed using stool culture, serology and rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) . However, culture and RDTs do not provide the genetic relatedness or diversity information that is critical to having insight into whether the outbreaks are seeded from existing local isolates or if the outbreaks represent separate transmission events, hence, the need to have genetic data in addition to culture and RDT data. If the isolates from one outbreak to the next are genetically closely related then, the outbreaks may have been seeded from existing local isolates. However, if the isolates from successive outbreaks are genetically distinct, then the outbreaks represent separate transmission events of V. cholerae into the region. Therefore, to determine the spread of specific genetic lineages of V. cholerae responsible for cholera outbreaks, the use of advanced molecular testing methods is recommended . Knowledge of genetic differences among isolates facilitates a greater understanding of the transmission within and between geographic regions and time periods . We performed multilocus variable number tandem repeat analysis (MLVA) and whole genome sequencing (WGS) on isolates from cholera outbreaks in 2009/2010, 2016and 2017/2018 in Zambia. This was a cross-sectional study analyzing isolates collected from each region of Zambia where microbiological culture facilities and long-term storage capabilities were available. It was a convenience sample. The isolates were recovered from stools that were plated and grown overnight on thiosulfate-citrate-bile salts-sucrose agar (TCBS). Permission to work on stored isolates was granted by the Ministry of Health and approved by the ethical review committee of The University of Zambia Biomedical Research Ethics Committee (UNZABREC- REF NO003–10-17). There were no human participants involved. All methods were performed in accordance with the relevant guidelines and regulations. The isolates were preserved on Whatman™ 903 filter paper (GE Healthcare Ltd., Cardiff UK) according to previously published methods and were shipped to Baltimore, Maryland, USA, for molecular testing ."
PMC8191489,2021-06-07,Airborne transmission pathway for coastal water pollution,"Each year, over one hundred million people become ill and tens of thousands die from exposure to viruses and bacteria from sewage transported to the ocean by rivers, estuaries, stormwater, and other coastal discharges. Water activities and seafood consumption have been emphasized as the major exposure pathways to coastal water pollution. In contrast, relatively little is known about the potential for airborne exposure to pollutants and pathogens from contaminated seawater. The Cross Surfzone/Inner-shelf Dye Exchange (CSIDE) study was a large-scale experiment designed to investigate the transport pathways of water pollution along the coast by releasing dye into the surfzone in Imperial Beach, CA. Additionally, we leveraged this ocean-focused study to investigate potential airborne transmission of coastal water pollution by collecting complementary air samples along the coast and inland. Aerial measurements tracked sea surface dye concentrations along 5+ km of coast at 2 m × 2 m resolution. Dye was detected in the air over land for the first 2 days during two of the three dye releases, as far as 668 m inland and 720 m downwind of the ocean. These coordinated water/air measurements, comparing dye concentrations in the air and upwind source waters, provide insights into the factors that lead to the water-to-air transfer of pollutants. These findings show that coastal water pollution can reach people through an airborne pathway and this needs to be taken into account when assessing the full impact of coastal ocean pollution on public health. This study sets the stage for further studies to determine the details and importance of airborne exposure to sewage-based pathogens and toxins in order to fully assess the impact of coastal pollution on public health.","Roughly half of the global population lives in coastal regions (U.S. Comission on Ocean Policy, 2004). The discharge of treated and untreated sewage, industrial effluents, agricultural drainage, and urban stormwater into coastal waters is a global public health concern (U.S. Comission on Ocean Policy, 2004; Shuval, 2003; Halpern et al., 2012). Chemical contaminants include metals, chlorinated pesticides, oil, fuel, soot, and butyltins, amongst others (National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, 2016). The United States Environmental Protection Agency lists 126 Priority Pollutants in industrial discharges, in addition to the many emerging contaminants of concern (United States Environmental Protection Agency, 2014; Hutchinson et al., 2013). But it is untreated sewage in coastal waters that is of primary concern because it often contains pathogens that can cause illness from a single exposure (Shuval, 2003; Gersberg et al., 2006; Griffin et al., 2003). Pathogenic viruses cause most cases of illness from contact with sewage contaminated waters (Shuval, 2003; Griffin et al., 2003). Serious illness can result from exposure to low numbers of viruses (i.e. 1’s–10’s) which have been shown to remain infectious in seawater longer than bacteria (Gersberg et al., 2006; Griffin et al., 2003; Schiff et al., 1983; Fong & Lipp, 2005; Munn, 2011). Over 100 enteric viruses—those affecting the gut—have been detected in contaminated waters, including hepatitis A virus (HAV) and norovirus, and SARS-CoV-2 virus is present in sewage (Gersberg et al., 2006; Munn, 2011; Lodder & de Roda Husman, 2020). Globally, over 120 million cases of gastrointestinal disease and more than 50 million cases of respiratory disease are estimated to be caused each year by people entering contaminated coastal waters (Shuval, 2003). Coastal water quality is an increasing challenge for developed and developing countries alike. San Diego County, CA, USA, has 80 km of coastline, much of which is impacted by seasonal stormwater runoff that enters the ocean untreated, a common occurrence in coastal cities worldwide (Gersberg et al., 2006; Griffin et al., 2003; Dwight et al., 2011; Steele et al., 2018). Human fecal pollution associated with stormwater runoff has been documented at San Diego beaches (Gersberg et al., 2006; Steele et al., 2018). The problem is compounded at Imperial Beach, San Diego County’s most southwesterly city, which lies across the border from Tijuana, Mexico. Rainfall in Tijuana River watershed results in both stormwater and sewage being discharged untreated into the Tijuana River, which empties into the ocean 2 km north of the US/Mexico border and pollutes the coastal waters on both sides. Specific infrastructure failures have resulted in additional releases of untreated sewage in recent years (Dibble & Smith, 2017; Hernandez, 2017). Moreover, other point sources of untreated sewage further south broaden the problem. The health risks are significant, with HAV having been detected in Imperial Beach’s coastal waters following rainfall (Gersberg et al., 2006). Beach water quality is monitored in San Diego on a weekly basis; when poor water quality is detected, beaches are closed to direct water contact (i.e. swimming, surfing) (County of San Diego Department of Environmental Health and Quality, 2017). But other forms of exposure to polluted water are possible, including airborne exposure, as we aim to demonstrate in this study."

This study attempts to identify high risk areas of schistosomiasis in China by using information value and machine learning. METHODS The local case distribution from schistosomiasis surveillance data in China between 2005 and 2019 was assessed based on 19 variables including climate, geography, and social economy. Seven models were built in three categories including information value (IV), three machine learning models [logistic regression (LR), random forest (RF), generalized boosted model (GBM)], and three coupled models (IV + LR, IV + RF, IV + GBM). Accuracy, area under the curve (AUC), and F1-score were used to evaluate the prediction performance of the models. The optimal model was selected to predict the risk distribution for schistosomiasis. RESULTS There is a more prone to schistosomiasis epidemic provided that paddy fields, grasslands, less than 2.5 km from the waterway, annual average temperature of 11.5–19.0 °C, annual average rainfall of 1000–1550 mm. IV + GBM had the highest prediction effect (accuracy = 0.878, AUC = 0.902, F1 = 0.920) compared with the other six models. The results of IV + GBM showed that the risk areas are mainly distributed in the coastal regions of the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River, the Poyang Lake region, and the Dongting Lake region. High-risk areas are primarily distributed in eastern Changde, western Yueyang, northeastern Yiyang, middle Changsha of Hunan province; southern Jiujiang, northern Nanchang, northeastern Shangrao, eastern Yichun in Jiangxi province; southern Jingzhou, southern Xiantao, middle Wuhan in Hubei province; southern Anqing, northwestern Guichi, eastern Wuhu in Anhui province; middle Meishan, northern Leshan, and the middle of Liangshan in Sichuan province. CONCLUSIONS The risk of schistosomiasis transmission in China still exists, with high-risk areas relatively concentrated in the coastal regions of the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River. Coupled models of IV and machine learning provide for effective analysis and prediction, forming a scientific basis for evidence-lead surveillance and control. GRAPHIC  [Image see text] SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION The online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1186/s40249-021-00874-9.","As one of 20 neglected tropical diseases, schistosomiasis is a typical zoonotic parasitic disease that remains a major public health problem worldwide . In the 1950s, schistosomiasis was endemic in 12 southern Chinese provinces in close proximity to the Yangtze River. China was one of the countries with the heaviest schistosomiasis burden with more than 10 million patients. Over the past 70 years of active control, China's schistosomiasis control program has achieved remarkable success . By the end of 2020, 337 (74.9%) of the 450 schistosomiasis endemic counties in China had achieved the elimination standard, 97 (21.6%) have achieved the transmission blocking standard and 16 (3.6%) have achieved transmission control . However, the risk of schistosomiasis transmission still exists in China because many natural conditions and socio-economic factors involved in the process of schistosomiasis transmission are difficult to change fundamentally in the short term [2, 3]. China’s 13th Five-Year Plan for national schistosomiasis control identifies risk monitoring and early warning to be essential to reduce potential transmission risk. Prediction model design is an effective means by which to achieve accurate monitoring and evidence-lead control of schistosomiasis . There are two methods for infectious disease risk prediction a knowledge-driven method (qualitative method), and a data-driven method (quantitative method) . There are four components to the process of development epidemic data processing, environmental factor selection, model construction, and model evaluation. In particular, the application of geographic information system (GIS), remote sensing (RS), and global positioning system (GPS) in infectious disease research accelerates the development of quantitative risk prediction . Commonly used qualitative methods are the analytic hierarchy process (AHP) and the Delphi method. For example, Ajakaye et al.  used AHP to evaluate the transmission risk of schistosomiasis in Nigeria. Yang et al.  used the Delphi method to establish a schistosomiasis early warning index in the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River. The results for early warning were consistent with epidemic levels based on a recent epidemiological survey. A single quantitative method or a combination of multiple quantitative methods is frequently used. Solano-Villarreal et al.  used a boosted regression tree to study the transmission risk of malaria in the Loreto area. Xia et al.  combined a variety of classification algorithms including random forest (RF) and a generalized boosted model (GBM) in BioMod2, to construct a combined model that predicted the potential distribution of Oncomelania hupensis in the Dongting Lake region. The combined model had greater prediction accuracy."
PMC8265026,2021-07-07,Estimation of the reproduction number of influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 in South Korea using heterogeneous models," The reproduction number is one of the most crucial parameters in determining disease dynamics, providing a summary measure of the transmission potential. However, estimating this value is particularly challenging owing to the characteristics of epidemic data, including non-reproducibility and incompleteness. METHODS In this study, we propose mathematical models with different population structures; each of these models can produce data on the number of cases of the influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 epidemic in South Korea. These structured models incorporating the heterogeneity of age and region are used to estimate the reproduction numbers at various terminal times. Subsequently, the age- and region-specific reproduction numbers are also computed to analyze the differences illustrated in the incidence data. RESULTS Incorporation of the age-structure or region-structure allows for robust estimation of parameters, while the basic SIR model provides estimated values beyond the reasonable range with severe fluctuation. The estimated duration of infectious period using age-structured model is around 3.8 and the reproduction number was estimated to be 1.6. The estimated duration of infectious period using region-structured model is around 2.1 and the reproduction number was estimated to be 1.4. The estimated age- and region-specific reproduction numbers are consistent with cumulative incidence for corresponding groups. CONCLUSIONS Numerical results reveal that the introduction of heterogeneity into the population to represent the general characteristics of dynamics is essential for the robust estimation of parameters.","The reproduction number is defined as the average number of secondary cases generated by a typical primary case. It is a measure of the transmission potential associated with the contact rate, duration of infectivity, and probability of transmission per contact. The maximum reproduction number is attained when an infectious person is introduced into a totally susceptible population and is called the basic reproduction number, R0. Various approaches such as the exponential growth rate of infections during the early epidemic stage, model-based schemes, and maximum-likelihood estimations have been used to analyze this number [1–4]. When an infection spreads throughout a population, the time-dependent effective reproduction number, Rt, is often more useful for assessing the transmission potential throughout a pandemic, especially during the period with the highest level of activity. Real-time estimation continues to track the number of secondary infections caused by a single infective, providing a quantitative measure of the time evolution of the epidemic force. Cruz-Pacheco et al. demonstrated the manner in which sanitary measures reduce the prevalence of an infected population . Estimates of the reproduction number were shown to decrease from 1.4-1.5 initially to 1.1-1.2 later in the summer, which was most likely because of the vacation period and the seasonality of influenza transmission . In addition to capturing temporal dynamics, it is important to consider heterogeneous patterns of the transmission. It is well known that school-age children are disproportionately responsible for influenza transmissions. Estimates of the age-specific reproduction number help with our understanding of the role of each group in the transmission dynamics and with devising effective targeting mitigation strategies."
PMC8323090,2021-07-30,Predicting temperature-dependent transmission suitability of bluetongue virus in livestock,"The transmission of vector-borne diseases is governed by complex factors including pathogen characteristics, vector–host interactions, and environmental conditions. Temperature is a major driver for many vector-borne diseases including Bluetongue viral (BTV) disease, a midge-borne febrile disease of ruminants, notably livestock, whose etiology ranges from mild or asymptomatic to rapidly fatal, thus threatening animal agriculture and the economy of affected countries. Using modeling tools, we seek to predict where the transmission can occur based on suitable temperatures for BTV. We fit thermal performance curves to temperature-sensitive midge life-history traits, using a Bayesian approach. We incorporate these curves into S(T), a transmission suitability metric derived from the disease’s basic reproductive number, [Formula see text] This suitability metric encompasses all components that are known to be temperature-dependent. We use trait responses for two species of key midge vectors, Culicoides sonorensis and Culicoides variipennis present in North America. Our results show that outbreaks of BTV are more likely between 15[Formula see text] C and [Formula see text] , with predicted peak transmission risk at 26 [Formula see text] C. The greatest uncertainty in S(T) is associated with the following the uncertainty in mortality and fecundity of midges near optimal temperature for transmission; midges’ probability of becoming infectious post-infection at the lower edge of the thermal range; and the biting rate together with vector competence at the higher edge of the thermal range. We compare three model formulations and show that incorporating thermal curves into all three leads to similar BTV risk predictions. To demonstrate the utility of this modeling approach, we created global suitability maps indicating the areas at high and long-term risk of BTV transmission, to assess risk and to anticipate potential locations of disease establishment. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION The online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1186/s13071-021-04826-y.","With ongoing climate change, it is critical that we understand how temperature influences the dynamics of emerging diseases. Vector-borne diseases (VBDs) are highly sensitive to climate factors, particularly temperature, as demonstrated previously for VBDs of both humans and plants [1–5]. Bluetongue virus (BTV), in the Reoviridae family (genus Orbivirus), causes bluetongue disease in livestock across the world and is thus a VBD of considerable economic concern. The biting midges of the Culicoides family are responsible for transmitting BTV and many other arboviruses. More than 1400 species of Culicoides have been classified globally, but fewer than 30 have been identified as competent vectors for BTV transmission . These midges are highly sensitive to changes in temperature [7, 8], and thus so is BTV transmission [9, 10]. BTV can infect most species of domestic and wild ruminants, including sheep, goats, and cattle . Sheep are the most susceptible to the disease and exhibit the highest morbidity and mortality post-infection [12, 13]. In the majority of infections by strains of BTV’s 27 serotypes, animals rarely show any clinical signs . The infection severity and the presence of clinical signs both depend on the serotype, and the severity of infection can range from rapid death to quick recovery. Common outward clinical signs include a blue tongue, fever, and excessive salivation . Since clinical signs are rare, BTV infection often goes without detection. Unfortunately, undetected cases can still result in mortality, and while BTV vaccines exist, vaccine development is in its infancy .

Feeding sites can favour high densities, home range overlap, greater sedentary behaviour and increased interspecific contacts, all of which might promote parasite transmission. In the Yunnan snub-nosed monkey (Rhinopithecus bieti), human interventions via provisioning monkeys at specific feeding sites have led to the sub-structuring of a group into genetically differentiated sub-groups. The fed subgroup is located near human hamlets and interacts with domesticated animals. Using high-throughput sequencing, we investigated Entamoeba species diversity in a local host assemblage strongly influenced by provisioning for wildlife-related tourism. We identified 13 Entamoeba species or lineages in faeces of Yunnan snub-nosed monkeys, humans and domesticated animals (including pigs, cattle, and domestic chicken). In Yunnan snub-nosed monkeys, Entamoeba prevalence and OTU richness were higher in the fed than in the wild subgroup. Entamoeba polecki was found in monkeys, pigs and humans, suggesting that this parasite might circulates between the wild and domestic components of this local social–ecological system. The highest proportion of faeces positive for Entamoeba in monkeys geographically coincided with the presence of livestock and humans. These elements suggest that feeding sites might indirectly play a role on parasite transmission in the Yunnan snub-nosed monkey. The implementation of such sites should carefully consider the risk of creating hotspots of disease transmission, which should be prevented by maintaining a buffer zone between monkeys and livestock/humans. Regular screenings for pathogens in fed subgroup are necessary to monitor transmission risk in order to balance the economic development of human communities dependent on wildlife-related tourism, and the conservation of the endangered Yunnan snub-nosed monkey.","Human societies are living one of the most important paradoxes concerning ecosystems while urbanization is increasing worldwide, interacting with nature is in ever-increasing demand1. Ecotourism is now considered to be one of the most thriving industries in the world and one of the most prominent cultural ecosystem services2,3. Besides providing these benefits, ecotourism is often an opportunity to promote educational programs that increase general audience awareness about ecosystem and endangered species conservation. However, protected areas developed for ecotourism are often mosaic habitats rather than wild landscapes. In other words, these may constitute agricultural, peri-urban, and fragmented areas in which the presence of humans and their activities would make them complex social–ecological systems4,5. Wildlife-related tourism faces strong expectations from tourists to observe animals in their habitats; efforts to increase animal visibility are rarely compatible with the main behavioural characteristics of wild animals, i.e. mobility and evasiveness6. Facilities attracting tourists to ready-to-view and highly dense animal groups are often a great commercial success, especially in the case of animal species that are unusual and/or endangered7,8. A common way to concentrate animals at a given location is to habituate them to food provisioning. Some conservation programs have successfully implemented food provisioning to declining endangered wildlife populations that are food limited in order to increase their population size9,10. Supplemental feeding might act positively on survival, reproduction and body condition, which can maintain and at best increase population size11. However, a debate exists on the cost–benefit trade-offs of supplemental feeding of wildlife. Most studies focusing on food provisioning observed the modification of behavioural, physiological and ecological patterns of fed populations, as well as negative consequences for animal health1,8,11,12. Feeding sites have the potential to favour wild animal aggregations at high densities and/or home range overlap, greater sedentary behaviour and increased interspecific contacts, all of which might promote parasite transmission11. Therefore, food provisioning is expected to indirectly increase parasite transmission, especially when parasites have a density-dependent transmission13."
PMC8366161,2021-08-16,Evaluation of two Plasmodium vivax sexual stage antigens as transmission-blocking vaccine candidates," Plasmodium vivax transmission-blocking vaccines (TBVs) are receiving increasing attention. Based on excellent transmission-blocking activities of the PbPH (PBANKA_0417200) and PbSOP26 (PBANKA_1457700) antigens in Plasmodium berghei, their orthologs in P. vivax, PVX_098655 (PvPH) and PVX_101120 (PvSOP26), were selected for the evaluation of their potential as TBVs. METHODS Fragments of PvPH (amino acids 22–304) and PvSOP26 (amino acids 30–272) were expressed in the yeast expression system. The recombinant proteins were used to immunize mice to obtain antisera. The transmission-reducing activities of these antisera were evaluated using the direct membrane feeding assay (DMFA) using Anopheles dirus mosquitoes and P. vivax clinical isolates. RESULTS The recombinant proteins PvPH and PvSOP26 induced robust antibody responses in mice. The DMFA showed that the anti-PvSOP26 sera significantly reduced oocyst densities by 92.0 and 84.1% in two parasite isolates, respectively, whereas the anti-PvPH sera did not show evident transmission-reducing activity. The variation in the DMFA results was unlikely due to the genetic polymorphisms of the two genes since their respective sequences were identical in the clinical P. vivax isolates. CONCLUSION PvSOP26 could be a promising TBV candidate for P. vivax, which warrants further evaluation.

In 2019, there were 229 million reported malaria cases in the world, resulting in more than 409,000 deaths . Plasmodium vivax is one of four human malaria parasites, with malaria caused by this parasite characterized by the recurrence of clinical symptoms every 48 h (tertian). Although less virulent than Plasmodium falciparum, P. vivax still poses a significant burden on the economy and public health in Asia and the Americas . Some malaria-infected people are asymptomatic but still infectious to mosquitoes and possibly serve as an important reservoir that contributes to the sustained transmission of malaria . In addition, large proportions of P. vivax infections are due to relapse from activation of the dormant hypnozoites in the liver [4, 5]. Vaccines hold great promise for the prevention, control and elimination of malaria. The malaria parasite life-cycle is complex and, therefore, multi-stage vaccines targeting antigens expressed in different parasite life stages are advocated. Transmission-blocking vaccines (TBVs) target the parasite’s sexual stage antigens or the mosquito’s midgut antigens, interrupting the parasite’s transmission through mosquitoes. TBVs are intended to induce herd immunity in the population without directly protecting the vaccinated individual; thus, they may also enhance the function of vaccines or drugs by preventing the spread of resistant parasites [6, 7]. An ideal TBV should inhibit multiple steps of sexual development, including gametocytogenesis, gametogenesis, fertilization and the maturation of the ookinete and its traversal of the mosquito midgut. Unfortunately, despite decades of research efforts, only a few TBV candidates have shown clear transmission-blocking (TB) activities. These TBV candidates mainly include the pre-fertilization antigens (P230, P48/45, P47 and HAP2) [8–11], the post-fertilization antigens (P25 and P28)  and the Anopheles mosquito midgut alanyl aminopeptidase N (AnAPN1) [13, 14]. The histidine-tagged Pvs25 expressed in yeast, Pvs25H, is the first P. vivax TBV to enter a phase 1 clinical trial . The Pvs25H protein with the adjuvant alhydrogel elicited antibodies that showed TB activity in the direct membrane feeding assay (DMFA). However, the second trial of Pvs25H with Montanide ISA 51, an oil-based immune adjuvant, was halted due to unexpected reactogenicity of the vaccine candidate in volunteers . The other two promising candidates, Pvs28 and AnAPN1, are still in pre-clinical trials [17, 18]. Thus, there is a pressing need to identify additional TBV candidates for P. vivax."
PMC8369200,2021-08-03,"Estimating the Transmissibility of Mumps: A Modelling Study in Wuhan City, China","Despite the adoption of a national immunization program in China, the incidence of mumps remains high. This study aimed to describe the epidemiological characteristics, including the time, region, occupation, and age, of mumps in Wuhan from 2005 to 2018 and to evaluate its transmissibility. In this study, the susceptible–exposed–infectious–asymptomatic–recovered (SEIAR) model fitted the actual incidence data of mumps. The effective reproduction number (R(t)) was used to evaluate and compare the transmission capacity in different areas. From 2005 to 2018, there were 36,415 cases. The incidence of mumps was highest among people aged 5–10 years (460.02 per 100,000). The SEIAR model fitted the reported mumps data well (P < 0.01). The median transmissibility (R(t)) was 1.04 (range = 0–2.50). There were two peak spreads every year (from March to May and from October to December). The R(t) peak always appeared in the first 2 months of the peak incidence rate. The peak time of the epidemic spread of mumps was 1–2 months earlier than the peak incidence rate. The prevention and control measures of vaccination for children aged 5–10 years should be taken before the peak transmission capacity each year, 2 months before the peak of the outbreak, to reduce the spread of mumps.","Mumps is an acute respiratory infectious disease caused by the mumps virus, Rubulavirus . It occurs mainly in children and adolescents and is highly transmissible . The main symptoms include fever, muscle pain, and headache. Pain and swelling of one or both parotid and salivary glands soon follow the presentation of the main symptoms. The mumps virus is a member of the Paramyxoviridae RNA family of viruses . It is an envelope RNA virus that is transmitted through the saliva, respiratory secretions, or close contact with an infected person . Up to 10% of patients with mumps develop encephalitis, which can lead to death or disability . Mumps is usually mild and self-limiting, but its burden should not be underestimated . Mumps is an epidemic viral disease worldwide. More than 90% of cases are not reported . From 2005 to 2010, an average of 560,000 cases were reported worldwide . In countries such as Egypt, where the population is not provided with routine mumps vaccination, the burden of mumps is very high (100–1,000 cases per 100,000 people), and the epidemic peak occurs every 2–5 years (5, 9). In several developed countries, the outbreak of mumps is cyclical because of vaccination being voluntary . Even in countries where mumps vaccines are used through national immunization programs, mumps demonstrates a recurrent trend (10–12). In the United States, for instance, mumps outbreaks occur in highly immunized school-age populations (13–15). In some countries, such as Iraq, the incidence rate of mumps has been increasing due to long-term military conflicts, economic sanctions, and wars ."
PMC8376111,2021-08-19,A five-component infection control bundle to permanently eliminate a carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii spreading in an intensive care unit," Carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii (CRAB) infection outbreaks are difficult to control and sometimes require cohorting of CRAB-positive patients or temporary ward closure for environmental cleaning. We aimed at controlling the deadly 2018 CRAB outbreak in a 12 bed- intensive care unit (ICU) including 9 beds in a 220 m open space. We implemented a new multimodal approach without ward closure, cohorting or temporarily limiting admissions. METHODS A five-component bundle was introduced in 2018 including reinforcement of hand hygiene and sample extension of screening, application of contact precautions to all patients, enhanced environmental sampling and the one-time application of a cycling radical environmental cleaning and disinfection procedure of the entire ICU. The ICU-CRAB incidence density (ID), ICU alcohol-based hand rub consumption and antibiotic use were calculated over a period of 6 years and intervention time series analysis was performed. Whole genome sequencing analysis (WGS) was done on clinical and environmental isolates in the study period. RESULTS From January 2013, nosocomial ICU-CRAB ID decreased from 30.4 CRAB cases per 1000 patients-days to zero cases per 1000 patients-days. Our intervention showed a significant impact (-2.9 nosocomial ICU-CRAB cases per 1000 bed-days), while no influence was observed for antibiotic and alcohol-based hand rub (AHR) consumption. WGS demonstrated that CRAB strains were clonally related to an environmental reservoir which confirms the primary role of the environment in CRAB ICU spreading. CONCLUSION A five-component bundle of continuous hand hygiene improvement, extended sampling at screening including the environment, universal contact precautions and a novel cycling radical environmental cleaning and disinfection procedure proved to be effective for permanently eliminating CRAB spreading within the ICU. Cohorting, admission restriction or ICU closure were avoided.

CRAB is difficult to eradicate from the environment due to its ability to persist on surfaces and reduced susceptibility to biocides [4, 5]. In this scenario, because of the propensity of CRAB to cause outbreaks in the healthcare setting, effective and targeted infection prevention and control (IPC) interventions are essential to stop CRAB spreading ."
PMC8378725,2021-08-10,Trip duration drives shift in travel network structure with implications for the predictability of spatial disease spread,"Human travel is one of the primary drivers of infectious disease spread. Models of travel are often used that assume the amount of travel to a specific destination decreases as cost of travel increases with higher travel volumes to more populated destinations. Trip duration, the length of time spent in a destination, can also impact travel patterns. We investigated the spatial patterns of travel conditioned on trip duration and find distinct differences between short and long duration trips. In short-trip duration travel networks, trips are skewed towards urban destinations, compared with long-trip duration networks where travel is more evenly spread among locations. Using gravity models to inform connectivity patterns in simulations of disease transmission, we show that pathogens with shorter generation times exhibit initial patterns of spatial propagation that are more predictable among urban locations. Further, pathogens with a longer generation time have more diffusive patterns of spatial spread reflecting more unpredictable disease dynamics.","During an infectious disease outbreak, anticipating where a pathogen will spread is an important part of planning an effective response [1,2]. The initial stages of an outbreak are typically characterized by spatial dynamics through the population from an introduction event, such as the 2014 Ebola outbreak in West Africa  and the COVID-19 pandemic  which started at the end of 2019. These outbreaks provide clear examples of how quickly a pathogen can spread through a highly susceptible population. The speed of spatial propagation depends not only on population susceptibility and intrinsic biological properties of the pathogen, but also on connectivity patterns driven by human travel [2,5]. Mathematical models have been used to predict this type of spatial dynamics, which has been crucial for informing deployment of interventions [1,6] for a range of pathogens including Ebola [7–9], influenza [10–12], SARS-CoV-1 [13–15], and the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 [16–18]. However, mathematical models of disease spread often exhibit complex dynamics [19–21] that have a limited prediction horizon  due to the inherent complexities of both disease transmission and human behavior. Therefore, recent methods have relied more heavily on detailed information about human mobility patterns [23–25] to inform the spatial dynamics of disease spread. Spatial connectivity in such models frequently relies on data and/or models of human mobility [2,26]. Ideally, mobility is derived from travel data such as travel surveys [27,28], call data records [29–31], air traffic data [8,32,33] or App data [34,35], but when these data are absent or incomplete, mechanistic models of human movement are often used [36–39]. These data and models are typically used to provide spatial structure in a metapopulation framework  of disease transmission, where subpopulations are treated as discrete units that are connected by travel volume (raw number or relative magnitude of trips among locations per unit time). However, the extent to which human mobility patterns can explain spatial disease dynamics depends on whether or not travel volume scales directly with the rate of transmission among subpopulations. While a direct-scaling scenario conveniently assumes a constant probability of onward transmission for all trips, the manner in which mobility scales with transmission depends on the specifics of epidemiological-relevant movement among locations. In particular, the number of potentially infectious contacts that occur between individuals [41–43]—which will depend largely on the duration of a trip [44,45]—is a key factor that determines the likelihood of onward transmission and the epidemiological-relevance of observed travel volume."
PMC8367792,2021-08-11,A seasonal model to assess intervention strategies for preventing periodic recurrence of Lassa fever,"Lassa haemorrhagic fever is listed in WHO's Blueprint priority list of diseases and pathogens prioritized for research and development, affecting several hundreds of thousands of people each year. Lassa fever is spread via infected Natal multimammate mice and also through human-to-human contacts and it is a particular threat to pregnant women. Despite its importance, relatively few mathematical models have been established for modelling Lassa fever transmission up to now. We establish and study a new compartmental model for Lassa fever transmission including asymptomatic carriers, quarantine and periodic coefficients to model annual weather changes. We determine parameter values providing the best fit to data from Nigerian states Edo and Ondo from 2018–20. We perform uncertainty analysis and PRCC analysis to assess the importance of different parameters and numerical simulations to estimate the possible effects of control measures in eradicating the disease. The results suggest that the most important parameter which might be subject of control measures is death rate of mice, while mouse-to-human and human-to-human transmission rates also significantly influence the number of infected. However, decreasing the latter two parameters seems insufficient to eradicate the disease, while a parallel application of decreasing transmission rates and increasing mouse death rate might be able to stop the epidemic.","The first descriptions of Lassa haemorrhagic fever (LHF) or Lassa fever for short date back to the 1950s, though the virus causing LHF was identified later, in 1969 . The disease got its name after the town Lassa in Northeast Nigeria, where the first cases happened. Lassa fever is an acute viral hemorrhagic fever caused by the Lassa virus belonging to the Arenaviridae family. The Natal multimammate rat (Mastomys natalensis), the African wood mouse (Hylomyscus pamfi) and the Guinea multimammate mouse (Mastomys erythroleucus) are hosts of Lassa virus (LASV) in Nigeria , , , . LASV prevalence in the rodent population was two to three times higher in the rainy season, which could be the aftermath of an improved survival of the virus outside the host under wet and relatively cold conditions , . Infected Natal multimammate mice shed the virus in urine and droppings. Infection might occur through touching contaminated materials, eating contaminated food, exposure to open cuts. Human-to-human transmission is uncommon and mainly occurs in hospitals and households . Sexual transmission has also been reported . Even after recovery, the virus remains for a long time in bodily fluids for 3–9 weeks in urine and 3 months in semen. According to the WHO report, Lassa fever is endemic in Nigeria and during the dry season (December–April) following the reproduction cycle of the mice in the wet season (May–June), the annual peak of human cases is usually observed . Virus is more stable when humidity in the atmosphere relatively declines. Transmission from infected rodents to humans mostly occurs inside houses in the dry season when the abundance of rodents is significantly increased , . Virus in the urine of rodents might also be a source of infectious airborne droplets. In the dry season, sweeping the floors might generate infectious microaerosols, which may be transmitted to humans, by inhalation of aerosols or inoculation to the mucous membranes , , . Lassa fever is also endemic in humans in Benin, Ghana, Guinea, Liberia, Mali, Sierra Leone and presumably further countries in West Africa. Here the number of infections per year is estimated between 100,000 and 300,000 with 5,000–10,000 deaths , . Lassa menaces mostly those who live in rural areas where multimammate rats are present, especially where poor sanitation and crowded living conditions are typical. Four out of five people infected with Lassa fever do not show any symptoms or have only mild symptoms, these include fever, tiredness, weakness, and headache. One out of five infected develop a severe multisystem disease. Symptoms of the severe form of the disease include bleeding gums, breathing problems, vomiting, pain in chest, back and abdomen, low blood pressure, facial swelling, hear loss, tremors, encephalitis. The disease has a lethality of approximately 1%, however, it is especially dangerous for women in late pregnancy. For this group, around 29% of the cases results in maternal death, while an 80–95% fetal and neonatal mortality is reported , , . Lower attack rates have been reported for children than for adults ."
PMC8387667,2021-08-26,An investigation of tuberculosis progression revealing the role of macrophages apoptosis via sensitivity and bifurcation analysis,"Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection features various disease outcomes clearance, latency, active disease, and latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) reactivation. Identifying the decisive factors for disease outcomes and progression is crucial to elucidate the macrophages-tuberculosis interaction and provide insights into therapeutic strategies. To achieve this goal, we first model the disease progression as a dynamical shift among different disease outcomes, which are characterized by various steady states of bacterial concentration. The causal mechanisms of steady-state transitions can be the occurrence of transcritical and saddle-node bifurcations, which are induced by slowly changing parameters. Transcritical bifurcation, occurring when the basic reproduction number equals to one, determines whether the infection clears or spreads. Saddle-node bifurcation is the key mechanism to create and destroy steady states. Based on these two steady-state transition mechanisms, we carry out two sample-based sensitivity analyses on transcritical bifurcation conditions and saddle-node bifurcation conditions. The sensitivity analysis results suggest that the macrophage apoptosis rate is the most significant factor affecting the transition in disease outcomes. This result agrees with the discovery that the programmed cell death (apoptosis) plays a unique role in the complex microorganism-host interplay. Sensitivity analysis narrows down the parameters of interest, but cannot answer how these parameters influence the model outcomes. To do this, we employ bifurcation analysis and numerical simulation to unfold various disease outcomes induced by the variation of macrophage apoptosis rate. Our findings support the hypothesis that the regulation mechanism of macrophage apoptosis affects the host immunity against tuberculosis infection and tuberculosis virulence. Moreover, our mathematical results suggest that new treatments and/or vaccines that regulate macrophage apoptosis in combination with weakening bacillary viability and/or promoting adaptive immunity could have therapeutic value.

Despite the availability of effective TB treatments, TB continues claiming 1.5 million lives per year by infecting one quarter of the global population (Sud et al. 2006; Lin and Flynn 2010). A characteristic feature for Tuberculosis infection is that infected individuals experience various disease outcomes, including clearance, latent infection (LTBI), and active disease. Approximately 10% of infected individuals clear the infection and another 10% progress to primary disease, while the majority of infected individuals become latently infected with no symptoms.

A better understanding on TB progression, especially LTBI reactivation, can help to improve the efficacy of therapeutic strategies, and enhance both the innate and adaptive immune responses. The life cycle of tuberculosis begins when aerosol droplets containing Mtb are inhaled by an uninfected individual. After inhalation, Mtb usually reach the alveoli of the lung, and are preferentially ingested by alveolar macrophages (Warner and Mizrahi 2007), then launch proliferation (Canetti 1955). This makes alveolar macrophages the main target cells for Mtb invasion (Gammack et al. 2005; Gideon and Flynn 2011). Even though activated macrophages can initialize phagocytosis, Mtb can also set up various strategies against macrophage killing and replicate within the host macrophages. Moreover, cytokine environment is also modified to favor the intracellular Mtb survival (BoseDasgupta and Pieters 2014; Orme et al. 2015). Innate immune responses are the crucial factor for the TB outcome (Orme et al. 2015). While the clearance of the phagocytized bacteria is also determined by the adaptive immunity, which is activated by innate immune signals (Torrado and Cooper 2013). These infected macrophages release chemotactic signals to recruit and activate migrating lymphocytes to the site of infection (Gammack et al. 2005; Gideon and Flynn 2011). The progressive immune responses lead to an aggregation of lymphocytes around mycobacteria-harboring macrophages, which is called a granuloma. Granulomas are able to isolate infected macrophages from the rest of the lung to limit the bacillary growth and spread of Mtb from intracellular Mtb replication, and so serve as an immune micro-environment to enhance the T cells and macrophages interactions (Russell et al. 2010; Gideon and Flynn 2011). On the other hand, the granuloma concealed Mtb switch to a non-replicating state, which is a typical feature to enable the bacillus persistence during the long TB latency period (Barry et al. 2009). Mtb has evolved new strategy to escape granulomas leak into the lung and expectorate bacilli (Ehlers and Schaible 2013). The granuloma then serves as a battle ground between mycobacteria and host immune cells. The host-pathogen dynamics decide granuloma to promote or inhibit the infection and then determine the disease outcomes (Ulrichs and Kaufmann 2006; Ehlers and Schaible 2013). An imbalanced interplay between Mtb and immune cells result in the failure of controlling infection, then lead to the LTBI reactivation (O’Garra et al. 2013)."
PMC8428665,2021-09-09,The role of urbanisation in the spread of Aedes mosquitoes and the diseases they transmit—A systematic review," This systematic review aims to assess how different urbanisation patterns related to rapid urban growth, unplanned expansion, and human population density affect the establishment and distribution of Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus and create favourable conditions for the spread of dengue, chikungunya, and Zika viruses. METHODS AND FINDINGS Following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines, a systematic review was conducted using the PubMed, Virtual Health Library, Cochrane, WHO Library Database (WHOLIS), Google Scholar, and and the Institutional Repository for Information Sharing (IRIS) databases. From a total of 523 identified studies, 86 were selected for further analysis, and 29 were finally analysed after applying all inclusion and exclusion criteria. The main explanatory variables used to associate urbanisation with epidemiological/entomological outcomes were the following human population density, urban growth, artificial geographical space, urban construction, and urban density. Associated with the lack of a global definition of urbanisation, several studies provided their own definitions, which represents one of the study’s limitations. Results were based on 8 ecological studies/models, 8 entomological surveillance studies, 7 epidemiological surveillance studies, and 6 studies consisting of spatial and predictive models. According to their focus, studies were categorised into 2 main subgroups, namely “Aedes ecology” and “transmission dynamics.” There was a consistent association between urbanisation and the distribution and density of Aedes mosquitoes in 14 of the studies and a strong relationship between vector abundance and disease transmission in 18 studies. Human population density of more than 1,000 inhabitants per square kilometer was associated with increased levels of arboviral diseases in 15 of the studies. CONCLUSIONS The use of different methods in the included studies highlights the interplay of multiple factors linking urbanisation with ecological, entomological, and epidemiological parameters and the need to consider a variety of these factors for designing effective public health approaches.","Rapid unplanned urbanisation in combination with climate and environmental change, increased global travel and trade, and other societal challenges has stimulated the emergence or reemergence of vector-borne diseases [1–3]. Various studies have indicated that the intensification of urbanisation favours the spread of these diseases, which may also flourish due to a greater density of people as well as domestic and peridomestic animals [4,5]. According to the United Nations (UN) , urbanisation is the process whereby the proportion of a population living in urban areas and by which a large number of people become permanently concentrated in relatively small areas forming a city. It is estimated that 55% of the world’s population resided in urban areas in 2018, while by 2050, 68% of the world’s population is projected to be urban . In addition, according to Bhatt and colleagues , areas where human population density is greater than or equal to 1,000 people per square kilometer are indicative of intense urbanisation, thus providing a suitable threshold for distinguishing urban from peri-urban and rural areas. According to Vlahov and colleagues , urbanisation refers to the change in size, density, and heterogeneity of cities, while factors such as population mobility, segregation, and industrialisation frequently accompany urbanisation. Thus, the process of urbanisation is not dependent on the definition of urban per se, but rather on the dynamics of agglomeration of individuals."
PMC8433339,2021-09-10,Selective targeting of the TLR2/MyD88/NF-κB pathway reduces α-synuclein spreading in vitro and in vivo,"Pathways to control the spreading of α-synuclein (α-syn) and associated neuropathology in Parkinson’s disease (PD), multiple system atrophy (MSA) and dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) are unclear. Here, we show that preformed α-syn fibrils (PFF) increase the association between TLR2 and MyD88, resulting in microglial activation. The TLR2-interaction domain of MyD88 (wtTIDM) peptide-mediated selective inhibition of TLR2 reduces PFF-induced microglial inflammation in vitro. In PFF-seeded A53T mice, the nasal administration of the wtTIDM peptide, NEMO-binding domain (wtNBD) peptide, or genetic deletion of TLR2 reduces glial inflammation, decreases α-syn spreading, and protects dopaminergic neurons by inhibiting NF-κB. In summary, α-syn spreading depends on the TLR2/MyD88/NF-κB pathway and it can be reduced by nasal delivery of wtTIDM and wtNBD peptides.","Parkinson’s disease (PD) is the most prevalent movement disorder affecting almost 6.1 million people worldwide1. The disease is caused by a specific loss of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) positive dopaminergic (DAergic) neurons present in substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc). One of the pathologic hallmarks of PD is the presence of Lewy bodies (LBs) containing aggregated α-syn. Lowering the deposition of aggregated α-syn from the brain parenchyma is expected to reduce the development and progression of not only sporadic and familial PD, but also dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) and multiple system atrophy (MSA)2–4. It has been well manifested that point mutations (A53T, A30P, E46K, etc.) in the N-terminal region of α-syn or over-expression of the WT protein by gene duplication and triplication initiate amyloidogenesis5, resulting in the formation of oligomeric and protofibrillar form of α-syn. Usually, α-syn aggregates are released from the neurons by exocytosis and the extracellular α-syn can spread into glial cells or neighboring neurons by cell-to-cell transfer or by non-cell-autonomous manner6–9, inducing chronic inflammation in affected brain regions10,11. However, mechanisms by which α-syn spreading could be controlled are poorly understood. Activation of TLR2 requires its association with downstream adapter protein MyD8812,13. Recently, we have delineated that peptides corresponding to the TLR2-interacting domain of MyD88 (TIDM) specifically inhibit the induction of TLR2 activation without inhibiting either basal TLR2 activity or the activation of other TLRs14."

To explore possible consequences of asymptomatic infections, particularly in the context of elimination of transmission—a goal set to be achieved by 2030—we propose a novel dynamic transmission model to account for the asymptomatic population. This extends an established framework, basing infection progression on a number of experimental and observation gHAT studies. Asymptomatic gHAT infections include those in people with blood-dwelling trypanosomes, but no discernible symptoms, or those with parasites only detectable in skin. Given current protocols, asymptomatic infection with blood parasites may be diagnosed and treated, based on observable parasitaemia, in contrast to many other diseases for which treatment (and/or diagnosis) may be based on symptomatic infection. We construct a model in which exposed people can either progress to either asymptomatic skin-only parasite infection, which would not be diagnosed through active screening algorithms, or blood-parasite infection, which is likely to be diagnosed if tested. We add extra parameters to the baseline model including different self-cure, recovery, transmission and detection rates for skin-only or blood infections. Performing sensitivity analysis suggests all the new parameters introduced in the asymptomatic model can impact the infection dynamics substantially. Among them, the proportion of exposures resulting in initial skin or blood infection appears the most influential parameter. For some plausible parameterisations, an initial fall in infection prevalence due to interventions could subsequently stagnate even under continued screening due to the formation of a new, lower endemic equilibrium. Excluding this scenario, our results still highlight the possibility for asymptomatic infection to slow down progress towards elimination of transmission. Location-specific model fitting will be needed to determine if and where this could pose a threat.","Gambiense human African trypanosomiasis (gHAT, sleeping sickness) is one of the often fatal neglected tropical diseases [1, 2], with the causative parasite, Trypanosoma brucei gambiense, transmitted to humans through the a bite of tsetse (Glossina). Transmission of gHAT has reduced significantly in the recent years—from 37,385 globally reported cases in 1998 to less that 1000 in 2019—thanks to a range of interventions in endemic areas . Tsetse are obligate blood-feeders and biological transmission of the parasite to humans is usually considered to be through the injection trypanosomes into blood during feeding. Trypanosomes can replicate in the blood and this is why gHAT infection is associated with presence of parasite in blood . However, various studies, in experimental animal models and recently in humans, observed localised aggregation of trypanosomes in the skin matrix [5–8]. Further animal experiments observe accumulation of sequestered trypanosomes in other organs such as the spleen, liver, brain, and extravascular adipose tissue [9–11]. The existence of parasites in skin has even been reported when there is an absence of detectable parasites in blood. These “skin-only” infections are postulated to cause infections which may spontaneously disappear without any treatment, or alternatively develop into a blood infection [12, 13]. Whilst most infection to vectors may be acquired through human blood, skin and perhaps adipose tissues are believed to play a role in transmission as well [5–7, 11]."
PMC8455652,2021-09-10,"The effect of public health awareness and behaviors on the transmission dynamics of syphilis in Northwest China, 2006–2018, based on a multiple-stages mathematical model","Syphilis, a sexually transmitted infectious disease caused by the bacterium treponema pallidum, has re-emerged as a global public health issue with an estimated 12 million people infected each year. Understanding the impacts of health awareness and behaviors on transmission dynamics of syphilis can help to establish optimal control strategy in different regions. In this paper, we develop a multiple-stage SIRS epidemic model taking into account the public health awareness and behaviors of syphilis. First, the basic reproduction number [Formula see text] is obtained, which determines the global dynamics behaviors of the model. We derive the necessary conditions for implementing optimal control and the corresponding optimal solution for mitigation syphilis by using Pontryagin's Maximum Principle. Based on the data of syphilis in Ningxia from 2006 to 2018, the parameterizations and model calibration are carried out. The fitting results are in good agreement with the data. Moreover, sensitivity analysis shows that the public awareness induced protective behaviors C(e), compliance of condom-induced preventability ε and treatment for the primary syphilis m play an important role in mitigating the risk of syphilis outbreaks. These results can help us gain insights into the epidemiology of syphilis and provide guidance for the public health authorities to implement health education programs.","Syphilis is a sexually transmitted infection caused by the bacterium treponema pallidum (CDC, 2021). In 2015, about 45.4 million people were infected with syphilis, with 6 million new cases (GBD 2015). During 2015, it caused about 107,000 deaths, down from 202,000 in 1990 (Lozano, 2012). After decreasing dramatically with the availability of penicillin in the 1940s, rates of infection have increased since the turn of the millennium in many countries, often in combination with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) (GBD，2015). This is believed to be partly due to increased promiscuity, prostitution, decreasing use of condoms, and unsafe sexual practices among men who have sex with men (Gao et al., 2009). Generally, syphilis is transmitted by sexual contact or during pregnancy from a mother to her baby. Because spirochete is able to pass through intact mucous membranes or compromised skin, it can be transmitted by kissing near a lesion, as well as oral, vaginal, and anal sex (Syphilis-act Sheet(D, 2019; Stamm, 2010). Approximately 30%–60% of those exposed to primary or secondary syphilis will get the disease. Its infectivity is exemplified by the fact that an individual inoculated with only 57 organisms has a 50% chance of being infected (Eccleston et al., 2008). Syphilis has been known as “the great imitator” as it may cause symptoms similar to many other diseases (Syphilis-act Sheet(D, 2019; Kent & Romanelli, 2008). The infection progresses through multiple stages when left untreated, including primary, secondary, latent, and tertiary stages. Infectious individuals can be in one of these four different stages, and the signs and symptoms vary depending on which stage they present (Kent & Romanelli, 2008). The primary stage classically presents with a single chancre (a firm, painless, non-itchy skin ulceration which usually has 1 cm–2 cm in diameter) though there may be multiple sores. In secondary syphilis, a diffuse rash occurs, which frequently involves the palms of the hands and soles of the feet. There may also be sores in the mouth or vagina. The latent syphilis can last for years with few or no symptoms. In tertiary syphilis, there are gummas (soft, non-cancerous growths), neurological problems, or heart symptoms. More details about these four stages are summarized in the following●Primary syphilis, usually lasting between 3 and 6 weeks, is typically acquired by direct sexual contact with another person of infectious lesions (Kent & Romanelli, 2008). Approximately 3–90 days after the initial exposure (average 21 days) a skin lesion, called a chancre, appears at the point of contact. This is classically (40% of the time) a single, firm, painless, non-itchy skin ulceration with a clean base and sharp borders approximately 0.3–3.0 cm in size (Eccleston et al., 2008).●Secondary syphilis occurs approximately four to ten weeks after the primary infection (Kent & Romanelli, 2008). While secondary disease is known for the many different ways it can manifest, symptoms most commonly involve the skin, mucous membranes, and lymph nodes (Syphilis-act Sheet(D, 2019). There may be a symmetrical, reddish-pink, non-itchy rash on the trunk and extremities, including the palms and soles.●Latent syphilis is defined as having serologic proof of infection without symptoms of disease (Kent & Romanelli, 2008). It is further described as either early (usually lasting over 10 weeks, and less than 1 year after secondary syphilis) or late (more than 1 year after secondary syphilis) in the United States (Syphilis-act Sheet(D, 2019). The United Kingdom uses a cut-off of two years for early and late latent syphilis. Early latent syphilis may have a relapse of symptoms in 25% of cases. Late latent syphilis is asymptomatic, and not as contagious as early latent syphilis (Aadland et al., 2013).●Tertiary syphilis may occur approximately 3–15 years after the initial infection, and may be divided into three different forms gummatous syphilis (15%), late neurosyphilis (6.5%), and cardiovascular syphilis (10%) (Syphilis-act Sheet(D, 2019). Without treatment, a third of infected people develop tertiary disease. People with tertiary syphilis are not infectious (Garnett et al., 1997)."
PMC8465711,2021-09-25,Modelling bluetongue risk in Kazakhstan," Bluetongue is a serious disease of ruminants caused by the bluetongue virus (BTV). BTV is transmitted by biting midges (Culicoides spp.). Serological evidence from livestock and the presence of at least one competent vector species of Culicoides suggests that transmission of BTV is possible and may have occurred in Kazakhstan. METHODS We estimated the risk of transmission using a mathematical model of the reproduction number R for bluetongue. This model depends on livestock density and climatic factors which affect vector density. Data on climate and livestock numbers from the 2466 local communities were used. This, together with previously published model parameters, was used to estimate R for each month of the year. We plotted the results on isopleth maps of Kazakhstan using interpolation to smooth the irregular data. We also mapped the estimated proportion of the population requiring vaccination to prevent outbreaks of bluetongue. RESULTS The results suggest that transmission of bluetongue in Kazakhstan is not possible in the winter from October to March. Assuming there are vector-competent species of Culicoides endemic in Kazakhstan, then low levels of risk first appear in the south of Kazakhstan in April before spreading north and intensifying, reaching maximum levels in northern Kazakhstan in July. The risk declined in September and had disappeared by October. CONCLUSION These results should aid in surveillance efforts for the detection and control of bluetongue in Kazakhstan by indicating where and when outbreaks of bluetongue are most likely to occur. The results also indicate where vaccination efforts should be focussed to prevent outbreaks of disease. GRAPHICAL  [Image see text] SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION The online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1186/s13071-021-04945-6.","Bluetongue (BT) is a viral disease of ruminants caused by bluetongue virus (BTV), which has now been identified on all continents except Antarctica [1–5]. Hematophagous midges in the genus Culicoides are biological vectors that transmit BTV from infected to susceptible ruminants; thus the global distribution of BTV coincides with the distribution of competent Culicoides insect vectors and appropriate climatic conditions. The extrinsic incubation period for the virus in the insect vector is many weeks at the minimum temperature for replication of the virus which is 11–13 °C. At higher temperatures, this is reduced to about 5 days at 25 °C and 2.5 days at 35 °C . Specifically, BTV exists in an extensive band that includes tropical, subtropical, and temperate regions of the world between latitudes of approximately 40° north and 35° south . Exceptions include regions of Asia and western North America, where BTV infection of cattle and sheep occurs as far as 50° north [7, 8] and, most recently, northern Europe. Serologically positive animals have been previously reported in Kazakhstan  and in Xinjiang in neighbouring China . Cattle imported from Russia into Kazakhstan have also been reported as seropositive . Cattle are usually asymptomatic carriers after being infected with BTV, but can be a potential virus reservoir and source of infection on the farm . The present distribution and risk of bluetongue in Kazakhstan is unknown. The extent of suitable vectors of the virus is also unknown, although the vector-competent species Culicoides obsoletus has been found in eastern Kazakhstan [11, 12]. Adult Culicoides are killed by cold winter temperatures, and BTV infections typically do not last for more than 63 days , which is not long enough for BT-infected animals to remain infectious to the vectors for the duration of the winter. However, in inner Mongolia, which also has cold winters, BT appears to be endemic , indicating that the virus can continue to transmit following long periods when the vector in inactive. Therefore, it seems that the virus somehow survives in overwintering midges or animals. A number of mechanisms have been speculated. These include levels of vector activity during mild winters, low numbers of chronic or latent infections in cattle, and horizontal or vertical transmission between cattle. Less likely mechanisms include alternative but unknown reservoir hosts or alternative vectors that are better able to overwinter . The risk of transmission is believed to be affected by the ruminant density, summer temperature, and rainfall (see reproduction number in the “Methods” section). Density of livestock affects the transmission between animals and the Culicoides vector, whilst higher temperatures and rainfall are required for vector activity. For example, C. obsoletus/C. scoticus occurs in regions where annual rainfall is greater than 700 mm, and adult activity starts when the temperature rises above 10 °C . Thus, an important part of developing a risk map for Kazakhstan is to model climate data with livestock density to estimate risk of transmission. Therefore, the objective of this study was to combine this data with a model for the basic reproduction model to indicate the geographical and seasonal risk of transmission in Kazakhstan."
PMC8500266,2021-10-08,Deciphering transmission dynamics and spillover of avian influenza viruses from avian species to swine populations globally,"Genome sequences of eleven avian influenza virus (AIV) subtypes have been reported in swine populations from seven countries until August 2020. To unravel the transmission dynamics and spillover events of AIVs from avian reservoirs to swine, full-length hemagglutinin (HA) sequences of AIV subtypes (n = 11) reported from various avian species and swine were retrieved from the ‘Influenza Research Database’. Phylogenetic analysis identified closely related avian and swine AIV sequences suggesting potential spillover events from multiple domestic and wild avian species, including chicken, duck, pigeon, goose, quail, and aquatic birds to swine. Furthermore, N-linked glycosylation analysis of these closely related AIV sequences supported the possibility of multiple spillover events of highly pathogenic H5N1 and low pathogenic H9N2 viruses from various avian species to swine. The principal coordinate analysis further validated these findings for H5N1 and H9N2 viruses; however, spillover events of the other nine AIV subtypes were limited. Interestingly, the presence of potential mammalian adaptation markers, particularly in some of the swine H5N1, H7N9, and H9N2 viruses, suggested that these viruses may have already adapted in swine. The occurrence and circulation of these AIVs in swine, especially the H5N1 and H9N2 viruses with numerous spillover events from the avian reservoirs to swine, pose a significant threat in terms of their reassortment with endemic swine viruses or circulating human influenza viruses within the swine which may facilitate the emergence of a novel influenza virus strain with pandemic potential.","Influenza A virus (IAV) is a member of the Orthomyxoviridae family with a broad avian and mammalian host range [34, 51, 54, 55, 57–59, 63]. Genomes of IAV comprise eight gene segments of a negative-sense single-stranded RNA . The IAV virion particle has two surface glycoproteins hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA). The acquisition of subtle alterations in amino acid sequences within the HA protein triggers seasonal influenza epidemics [4, 49]. In contrast, the reassortments of different IAV subtypes co-infecting a host trigger the emergence of a novel IAV strain, which may be able to start a pandemic in an immunologically naive population [3, 4, 36, 38]. Due to the constant evolution of IAV, 18 HA and 11 NA subtypes have been reported infecting various avian and mammalian hosts [20, 27, 48]. The 1918 Spanish flu was the first and the deadliest of all the four influenza pandemics that occurred so far. One complete genome sequence of 1918 Spanish flu was recently obtained from a single victim buried under the permafrost in Alaska [40, 50], and four partial genome sequences were obtained from archival biopsies . Analyses of these sequences and other contemporary IAV sequences determined that the 1918 H1N1 pandemic virus originated from an avian reservoir that was most likely transmitted to the human population shortly before the emergence of the Spanish flu pandemic . More recently, the 2009 swine flu pandemic originated during March–May 2009 in the Mexican swine [14, 34]. The role of migratory birds and long-distance swine trades with human interaction were the primary factors responsible for the 2009 swine flu pandemic [14, 34]."
PMC8505157,2021-11-01,The barrier functions of crude cervical mucus plugs against HIV-1 infection in the context of cell-free and cell-to-cell transmission,"The cervical mucus plugs are enriched with proteins of known immunological functions. We aimed to characterize the anti-HIV-1 activity of the cervical mucus plugs against a panel of different HIV-1 strains in the contexts of cell-free and cell-associated virus. DESIGN A cohort of consenting HIV-1-negative and HIV-1-positive pregnant women in labour was recruited from Mthatha General Hospital in the Eastern Cape province of South Africa, from whom the cervical mucus plugs were collected in 6 M guanidinium chloride with protease inhibitors and transported to our laboratories at −80 °C. METHODS Samples were centrifuged to remove insoluble material and dialysed before freeze--drying and subjecting them to the cell viability assays. The antiviral activities of the samples were studied using luminometric reporter assays and flow cytometry. Time-of-addition and BlaM-Vpr virus-cell fusion assays were used to pin-point the antiviral mechanisms of the cervical mucus plugs, before proteomic profiling using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. RESULTS The proteinaceous fraction of the cervical mucus plugs exhibited anti-HIV-1 activity with inter-individual variations and some degree of specificity among different HIV-1 strains. Cell-associated HIV-1 was less susceptible to inhibition by the potent samples whenever compared with the cell-free HIV-1. The samples with high antiviral potency exhibited a distinct proteomic profile when compared with the less potent samples. CONCLUSION The crude cervical mucus plugs exhibit anti-HIV-1 activity, which is defined by a specific proteomic profile.","Mucosal surfaces lining the internal tracts of the body are vulnerable to damage by exogenous factors mostly through air and food intake [1–4]. A thin layer of mucus gel lines the various mucosae, regulates access of exogenous factors into the underlying epithelia, and protects against its desiccation . Crude mucus consists of mucins, nonmucin proteins, lipids, water (95–97%) and cell debris [1,2]. Mucins are a large family of heavily glycosylated proteins of high molecular weight (0.5–20 MDa), which are either membrane-bound or secreted as gel-forming and nongel-forming, depending on their ability to polymerize and crosslink into a gel . Their genes have been mapped on several chromosomes across the human genome . Crude saliva, its purified mucins  and mucins purified from breast milk  inhibit HIV-1 in in-vitro assays. The cervix produces ∼60 mg of mucus per day, the viscosity of which changes periodically with fluctuating levels of oestrogen and progesterone , thus regulating access of the spermatozoa into the uterus. Mucus is receptive or resistant during the oestrogen-dominant or progesterone-dominant phases, respectively, with the latter phase blocking access into the uterus . Antimicrobials in the cervical mucus strengthen its barrier functions against invading pathogens [8,9], whereas the constant mucus turnover ensures their clearance from the female reproductive tract (FRT) . During the early stages of pregnancy, increasing progesterone levels drive the formation of the cervical mucus plug (CMP) in the cervix, which blocks bacterial entry into the uterus, failure of which may cause life-threatening obstetrical problems [11,12]."
PMC8453343,2021-09-06,Adherence to Telemonitoring Therapy for Medicaid Patients With Hypertension: Case Study," Almost 50% of the adults in the United States have hypertension. Although clinical trials indicate that home blood pressure monitoring can be effective in managing hypertension, the reported results might not materialize in practice because of patient adherence problems. OBJECTIVE The aims of this study are to characterize the adherence of Medicaid patients with hypertension to daily telemonitoring, identify the impacts of adherence reminder calls, and investigate associations with blood pressure control. METHODS This study targeted Medicaid patients with hypertension from the state of Texas. A total of 180 days of blood pressure and pulse data in 2016-2018 from a telemonitoring company were analyzed for mean transmission rate and mean blood pressure change. The first 30 days of data were excluded because of startup effects. The protocols required the patients to transmit readings by a specified time daily. Patients not transmitting their readings received an adherence reminder call to troubleshoot problems and encourage transmission. The patients were classified into adherent and nonadherent cohorts; adherent patients were those who transmitted data on at least 80% of the days. RESULTS The mean patient age was 73.2 (SD 11.7) years. Of the 823 patients, 536 (65.1%) were women, and 660 (80.2%) were urban residents. The adherent cohort (475/823, 57.7%) had mean transmission rates of 74.9% before the adherence reminder call and 91.3% after the call, whereas the nonadherent cohort (348/823, 42.3%) had mean transmission rates of 39% and 58% before and after the call, respectively. From month 1 to month 5, the transmission rates dropped by 1.9% and 10.2% for the adherent and nonadherent cohorts, respectively. The systolic and diastolic blood pressure values improved by an average of 2.2 and 0.7 mm Hg (P<.001 and P=.004), respectively, for the adherent cohort during the study period, whereas only the systolic blood pressure value improved by an average of 1.6 mm Hg (P=.02) for the nonadherent cohort. CONCLUSIONS Although we found that patients can achieve high levels of adherence, many experience adherence problems. Although adherence reminder calls help, they may not be sufficient. Telemonitoring lowered blood pressure, as has been observed in clinical trials. Furthermore, blood pressure control was positively associated with adherence.","Hypertension affects nearly half of the adults in the United States, costs approximately US $131 billion annually, and is a major risk factor for cardiovascular disease and stroke [1-3]. Researchers have estimated the hazard ratios of cardiovascular events, stroke, and all-cause mortality to be 1.11-1.42, 1.28-1.40, and 1.02-1.13, respectively, for every 10 mm Hg increase in the ambulatory systolic blood pressure value . Nonetheless, approximately only 1 in 4 adults with hypertension have their blood pressure under control . Home blood pressure monitoring is an emerging strategy to help control hypertension, with many medical organizations recommending its use in diagnosis, distinguishing between blood pressure phenotypes, and ongoing hypertension management . Several meta-analyses of published clinical trials have found evidence that home blood pressure monitoring can lead to clinically significant reductions in blood pressure values when accompanied by additional support services such as medication titration, education, and lifestyle counseling [6-9]."
PMC8525980,2021-10-17,Viromes and surveys of RNA viruses in camel-derived ticks revealing transmission patterns of novel tick-borne viral pathogens in Kenya,"Tick-borne viruses (TBVs) capable of transmitting between ticks and hosts have been increasingly recognized as a global public health concern. In this study, Hyalomma ticks and serum samples from camels were collected using recorded sampling correlations in eastern Kenya. Viromes of pooled ticks were profiled by metagenomic sequencing, revealing a diverse community of viruses related to at least 11 families. Five highly abundant viruses, including three novel viruses (Iftin tick virus, Mbalambala tick virus [MATV], and Bangali torovirus [BanToV]) and new strains of previously identified viruses (Bole tick virus 4 [BLTV4] and Liman tick virus [LMTV]), were characterized in terms of genome sequences, organizations, and phylogeny, and their molecular prevalence was investigated in individual ticks. Moreover, viremia and antibody responses to these viruses have been investigated in camels. MATV, BLTV4, LMTV, and BanToV were identified as viral pathogens that can potentially cause zoonotic diseases. The transmission patterns of these viruses were summarized, suggesting three different types according to the sampling relationships between viral RNA-positive ticks and camels positive for viral RNA and/or antibodies. They also revealed the frequent transmission of BanToV and limited but effective transmission of other viruses between ticks and camels. Furthermore, follow-up surveys on TBVs from tick, animal, and human samples with definite sampling relationships are suggested. The findings revealed substantial threats from the emerging TBVs and may guide the prevention and control of TBV-related zoonotic diseases in Kenya and in other African countries.","Ticks are common hematophagous arthropods that can infest and spread pathogenic bacteria, protozoans, rickettsia, and viruses to human and animal hosts by sucking their blood [1–3]. The significance of tick-borne viral diseases (TBVDs) in human health has been increasingly recognized in recent decades. Newly emerging tick-borne viral pathogens causing febrile human diseases, such as severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome virus , Heartland virus , Alongshan virus , Jingmen tick virus , and Songlin virus , have been identified in North American and East Asian countries. Furthermore, the re-emergence and continuous spread of known tick-borne viruses (TBVs), such as Crimean – Congo hemorrhagic fever virus (CCHFV), Kyasanur Forest virus, Alkhurma hemorrhagic fever virus, Powassan virus, Deer tick virus, and African swine fever virus, positively correlate with the increasing incidence of TBVDs in humans and animals . Recently, many undefined viruses were discovered in ticks, promote our knowledge of the biodiversity and evolution of viruses vectored by ticks. Viromes of different tick species in various hosts collected in China , Australia , Brazil , Turkey , and the United States [14,15] have suggested a worldwide distribution and high prevalence of zoonotic TBVs. However, studies on TBVDs in African countries are limited. Epidemiological studies have identified viral pathogens related to severe human diseases in Africa, such as CCHFV  and tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV) . These human disease-causing viruses have high seroprevalence in domestic animals and livestock farmers in Uganda , Tunisia , Senegal , Sudan , and Kenya . Kenya is a sub-Saharan country predicted to have a higher risk of human CCHF infection [23,24]. Although a few human cases of CCHFV infection have been reported, with the first case recorded in 2002 in Kenya , the potential risks of CCHF outbreaks and epidemics in Kenya should not be underestimated as a high seroprevalence in humans and high infection rates of CCHFV in ticks have been reported in recent decades [16,17,22,26,27]. Although no cases of infection have been reported, TBVs such as Dhori virus and Dugbe virus (DUGV), associated with human and livestock diseases, have been isolated from ticks in Kenya . This finding suggests that the Kenyan population has a significant risk of developing TBVDs. In addition, other novel viral pathogens might not have been recognized or fully characterized due to technological limitations. For instance, the Kupe virus, a novel virus closely related to DUGV isolated from ticks in Kenya in 1999, was only fully sequenced and genetically characterized in 2009 when the appropriate technology became available [29–31]. To date, the potential health threats from transmission and infection of TBVs among humans and domestic animals in Kenya are poorly understood. Therefore, profiling viruses in ticks and investigating the substantial contacts between ticks and human or animal hosts is urgently needed to better understand the viral sphere vectored by ticks and identify the potential viral pathogens in Kenya."
PMC8553057,2021-10-28,Injurious information propagation and its global stability considering activity and normalized recovering rate,"This paper establishes a compartment model describing the propagation of injurious information among a well-mixed population. We define the information’s injuriousness as the people practicing the information being injured and leaving the system. Some informed people practice the information and are active, while others do not practice and are inactive. With the recovery resources fixed, the two groups of informed people’s recovering rates are normalized considering the information features. The stability of the nonlinear system is thoroughly studied. Analyzing the reproduction number of the injurious information, we find that in general parameter space, when there are people in an informed compartment, it is not always necessary to consider their recovery resource allocation. Instead, only when their proportion reaches a critical point should it be allocated. Unless the people in an informed compartment form a certain proportion, we can take a laissez-faire attitude towards them. In a more realistic parameter space, once inactive informed people exist, they should be allocated recovery resources. On the one hand, when the recovering rate rises, the focus on both groups of informed people is necessary for more situations. On the other hand, when the rate of active informed people leaving the system rises, ignoring active informed people benefits removing the injurious information in more cases. The model provides qualitative ways in the scenarios of removing injurious information.","Kermack and McKendrick  first proposed an SIR compartment model depicting epidemic propagation. In the classical SIR model, according to the heterogeneity of people’s state of the epidemic, the well-mixed population is divided into three compartments susceptible (S), infected (I), and recovered (R). Assuming the infection rate is α, the recovering rate is ω. Then, in a unit time, there are αSI susceptible becoming infected, and ωI infected becoming recovered. The SIR model being not suitable for all kinds of epidemics, a variety of classical epidemic models (e.g., the SEIR model) were proposed concerning the characteristics of different epidemics. In the classical SEIR model, compartment E is exposed, and after infection, the susceptible will not immediately have infectivity but will be exposed first. Although the mathematical form of compartment models seems simple, the research on their deep mathematical essence has never been interrupted. For instance, in 2020, the accurate solutions of the SIR epidemic model [2–4] and the SEIR epidemic model are found . In general, the compartment models are usually idealized. While some works are data-driven , most of others can guide some epidemic prevention and control problems in the real world only at the qualitative level but without real data [7–10]. The stability analysis attaches tremendous significance to compartment models. With the development of modern control theory, it is incorporated into the research framework of nonlinear dynamics. For the local stability, van den Driessche and Watmough  proposed a general method for finding the basic reproduction number, which can be used to judge the local stability of the epidemic-free equilibrium. Lyapunov’s Second Method and Lasalle’s Invariance Principle [12, 13] are essential mathematical tools for global stability analysis. The global stability of the classical SEIR model was analyzed by Li et al. [14, 15]. Various additional mechanisms were then implemented to the SEIR model with the global stability completely analyzed; for example, the immigration of different compartments , the nonlinear transmission rate [17, 18], the distributed delays , the discontinuous treatment , the age-dependent latency and relapse , the non-monotone incidence rates [21–23]. Global stability analysis was also carried out in epidemic models with real backgrounds [24, 25]. Some literature has summarized the general global stability analysis methods for several classical compartment models [26, 27]."
PMC8568186,2021-10-25,Towards soil-transmitted helminths transmission interruption: The impact of diagnostic tools on infection prediction in a low intensity setting in Southern Mozambique,"World Health Organization goals against soil-transmitted helminthiases (STH) are pointing towards seeking their elimination as a public health problem reducing to less than 2% the proportion of moderate and heavy infections. Some regions are reaching WHO goals, but transmission could rebound if strategies are discontinued without an epidemiological evaluation. For that, sensitive diagnostic methods to detect low intensity infections and localization of ongoing transmission are crucial. In this work, we estimated and compared the STH infection as obtained by different diagnostic methods in a low intensity setting. We conducted a cross-sectional study enrolling 792 participants from a district in Mozambique. Two stool samples from two consecutive days were collected from each participant. Samples were analysed by Telemann, Kato-Katz and qPCR for STH detection. We evaluated diagnostic sensitivity using a composite reference standard. By geostatistical methods, we estimated neighbourhood prevalence of at least one STH infection for each diagnostic method. We used environmental, demographical and socioeconomical indicators to account for any existing spatial heterogeneity in infection. qPCR was the most sensitive technique compared to composite reference standard 92% (CI 83%– 97%) for A. lumbricoides, 95% (CI 88%– 98%) for T. trichiura and 95% (CI 91%– 97%) for hookworm. qPCR also estimated the highest neighbourhood prevalences for at least one STH infection in a low intensity setting. While 10% of the neighbourhoods showed a prevalence above 20% when estimating with single Kato-Katz from one stool and Telemann from one stool, 86% of the neighbourhoods had a prevalence above 20% when estimating with qPCR. In low intensity settings, STH estimated prevalence of infection may be underestimated if based on Kato-Katz. qPCR diagnosis outperformed the microscopy methods. Thus, implementation of qPCR based predictive maps at STH control and elimination programmes would disclose hidden transmission and facilitate targeted interventions for transmission interruption.","More than 1 billion people have soil-transmitted helminths (STH) infection, worms that develop part of their life cycle in the soil and are transmitted to humans by egg ingestion or skin penetration. They are Ascaris lumbricoides, Trichiuris trichiura, Necator americanus and Ancylostoma duodenale. These infections are widely distributed in tropical and subtropical areas, with the greatest burden on children and on poor populations. People with light intensity STH infections can be asymptomatic, but heavier infections can cause anaemia, malnutrition, impaired growth and delayed development, among others . Thus, the World Health Organization 2021–2030 Neglected Tropical Diseases Roadmap has set the ambitious goal of reducing the proportion of moderate and high intensity infections to less than 2% in 70% and 96% of endemic countries by 2025 and 2030, respectively . The mainstay of STH morbidity control strategy is mass drug administration (MDA) with anthelmintics to population at risk, once a year if prevalence is over 20% and twice a year if it is over 50%. To decrease transmission and reinfection, WHO also recommends interventions intended to increase the accessibility to safe water, improved sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) ."
PMC8574928,2021-11-08,Global diversity of the gene encoding the Pfs25 protein—a Plasmodium falciparum transmission-blocking vaccine candidate," Vaccines against the sexual stages of the malarial parasite Plasmodium falciparum are indispensable for controlling malaria and abrogating the spread of drug-resistant parasites. Pfs25, a surface antigen of the sexual stage of P. falciparum, is a leading candidate for transmission-blocking vaccine development. While clinical trials have reported that Pfs25-based vaccines are safe and effective in inducing transmission-blocking antibodies, the extent of the genetic diversity of Pfs25 in malaria endemic populations has rarely been studied. Thus, this study aimed to investigate the global diversity of Pfs25 in P. falciparum populations. METHODS A database of 307 Pfs25 sequences of P. falciparum was established. Population genetic analyses were performed to evaluate haplotype and nucleotide diversity, analyze haplotypic distribution patterns of Pfs25 in different geographical populations, and construct a haplotype network. Neutrality tests were conducted to determine evidence of natural selection. Homology models of the Pfs25 haplotypes were constructed, subjected to molecular dynamics (MD), and analyzed in terms of flexibility and percentages of secondary structures. RESULTS The Pfs25 gene of P. falciparum was found to have 11 unique haplotypes. Of these, haplotype 1 (H1) and H2, the major haplotypes, represented 70% and 22% of the population, respectively, and were dominant in Asia, whereas only H1 was dominant in Africa, Central America, and South America. Other haplotypes were rare and region-specific, resulting in unique distribution patterns in different geographical populations. The diversity in Pfs25 originated from ten single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) loci located in the epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like domains and anchor domain. Of these, an SNP at position 392 (GGA/GCA), resulting in amino acid substitution 131 (Gly/Ala), defined the two major haplotypes. The MD results showed that the structures of H1 and H2 variants were relatively similar. Limited polymorphism in Pfs25 could likely be due to negative selection. CONCLUSIONS The study successfully established a Pfs25 sequence database that can become an essential tool for monitoring vaccine efficacy, designing assays for detecting malaria carriers, and conducting epidemiological studies of P. falciparum. The discovery of the two major haplotypes, H1 and H2, and their conserved structures suggests that the current Pfs25-based vaccines could be used globally for malaria control. GRAPHICAL  [Image see text] SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION The online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1186/s13071-021-05078-6.","The Plasmodium parasite must complete its development in a vertebrate host and transmit to a vector to continue its life cycle. Sexual stages of the malaria parasite, from gametocytes in the vertebrate host to ookinetes in the mosquito, offer potential targets for malaria intervention [1–3]. Although the numbers of gametocytes in the blood circulation are relatively fewer than the blood-stage parasites, and gametocytes can weakly induce immune responses , studies have shown that antibodies induced by vaccination with gametocyte and gamete antigens, such as Pfs48/45, Pfs47, and Pfs230, could interfere with gametocytogenesis and thereby may reduce the number of gametes and/or block fertilization [5–7]. Similarly, zygote- or midgut ookinete-targeting antibodies, such as Pfs25, have been experimentally induced and shown to effectively block malaria transmission [8–10]. These antigens are the leading candidates for transmission-blocking vaccine development. Such vaccines aim to reduce the spread of the malaria parasite among humans by preventing infections by Anopheles mosquito vectors, thereby representing an important tool for malaria control . Pfs25, a Cys-rich protein comprised of 217 amino acid residues, has a molecular weight of 25 kDa  and is encoded by the Pfs25 gene that spans 654 bp in size and is located on chromosome 10 of P. falciparum [13, 14]. Pfs25 expression, which can be detected as early as in macrogametes, dramatically increases in the zygotes and maturing ookinetes [15, 16]. Pfs25 contains a predicted signal sequence at the N-terminus, followed by four tandem epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like domains attached to the anchor domain at the C-terminus; the structure is stabilized with 22 Cys forming 11 disulfide bonds . The EGF-like domain acts as a ligand interacting with laminin, which is located at the basal lamina of the midgut epithelium of the mosquito. The interaction between Pfs25 and the laminin proteins forms the receptor/ligand complex, which can regulate the development of the malaria parasite in the mosquito vector . Homologs of Pfs25 have been identified in other species of human malaria parasite P. vivax (Pvs25) and in a rodent malaria parasite P. berghei (Pbs25) [19–21]. The genetic disruption of Pbs25 results in a partial inhibition of malaria transmission to A. stephensi, whereas double knockout of Pbs25 and ookinete gene Pbs28 results in a nearly 100% reduction in oocyst formation, thereby blocking malaria transmission completely . These studies demonstrate that Pfs25 could play an important role in the sexual stage development of the malaria parasite. Furthermore, P. berghei expressing Pfs25 is susceptible to anti-Pfs25 antibodies of humans [23, 24]. Thus, this system could provide a platform for assessing and optimizing Pfs25-based vaccines."
PMC8575988,2021-11-08,Estimating severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome transmission using machine learning methods in South Korea,"Severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome (SFTS) is an emerging tick-borne infectious disease in China, Japan, and Korea. This study aimed to estimate the monthly SFTS occurrence and the monthly number of SFTS cases in the geographical area in Korea using epidemiological data including demographic, geographic, and meteorological factors. Important features were chosen through univariate feature selection. Two models using machine learning methods were analyzed the classification model in machine learning (CMML) and regression model in machine learning (RMML). We developed a novel model incorporating the CMML results into RMML, defined as modified-RMML. Feature importance was computed to assess the contribution of estimating the number of SFTS cases using modified-RMML. Aspect to the accuracy of the novel model, the performance of modified-RMML was improved by reducing the MSE for the test data as 12.6–52.2%, compared to the RMML using five machine learning methods. During the period of increasing the SFTS cases from May to October, the modified-RMML could give more accurate estimation. Computing the feature importance, it is clearly observed that climate factors such as average maximum temperature, precipitation as well as mountain visitors, and the estimation of SFTS occurrence obtained from CMML had high Gini importance. The novel model incorporating CMML and RMML models improves the accuracy of the estimation of SFTS cases. Using the model, climate factors, including temperature, relative humidity, and mountain visitors play important roles in transmitting SFTS in Korea. Our findings highlighted that the guidelines for mountain visitors to prevent SFTS transmissions should be addressed. Moreover, it provides important insights for establishing control interventions that predict early identification of SFTS cases.","Severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome (SFTS) is an emerging tick-borne infectious disease in China, Japan, and Korea, caused by a novel bunyavirus SFTS virus (SFTSV) belonging to the Phlebovirus genus. SFTS was listed as one of the nine most infectious diseases in the World Health Organization priority list in 20171. SFTS is an increasingly important threat to public health because it is an infectious disease with a high fatality rate, and the number of countries affected with SFTS has increased. SFTS is characterized by high fever, thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, gastrointestinal symptoms (vomiting and diarrhea), hemorrhage, and multiorgan dysfunction2. The incubation period of SFTS is generally 6–14 days, with an average of 9 days3. The average case fatality rate varies from 8 to 12%, but it can be as high as 30%4. SFTS cases were first reported in China in 2009 and in Korea and Japan in 20135. SFTSV has been detected in several species of ticks, including Haemaphysalis longicornis, Amblyomma testudinarium, and Ixodes nipponensis. SFTSV has been detected in various reservoir animal species including domestic animals such as cats, mice, and wild boars and has been incidentally detected in humans6. Although there is neither a specific vaccine nor antiviral treatment for SFTS, SFTSV has a wide distribution, and epidemic areas of SFTS have been expanding7; therefore, it poses a significant threat to global health.

PMC8621835,2021-11-12,Reduction in Blood Lead Concentration in Children across the Republic of Georgia following Interventions to Address Widespread Exceedance of Reference Value in 2019,"In recent years, reports of lead contamination have dramatically increased in Georgia. Given concerns about the exposure of children to lead (Pb), the National Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey (MICS-2018) included a blood sampling component. The results showed that 41% of the children that participated had blood Pb levels (BLL) ≥ 5 µg/dL and that BLL in children living in Western Georgia were higher than those in Eastern regions. In response to these findings, NCDC implemented written and verbal advice to the families of children who participated in the MICS-2018 on how to reduce Pb exposure. From August 2019 onwards, the state program of clinical follow-up was implemented. The design of this study was a longitudinal study. The intervention of interest was the public health advice and medical follow-up, and the outcome was defined as the difference in BLL between the MICS-2018 survey and the state program follow-up. We observed a significant overall reduction in median BLL between MICS-2018 and state program follow-up in both August 2019 and the latest results (until December 2019). However, we did not observe any significant further reduction between August and the most recent BLL results. In the Georgian setting, written and verbal communication targeting individual households, alongside home visits to the most exposed, effectively reduced BLL in children.","In 2011, 2015 and 2017, the New York Health Department found significantly high levels of Pb in Georgian spices and in the blood of Georgian expats living in New York . Over a similar period, Tbilisi State University conducted a study in 2017 in Kvemo Kartli districts (Bolnisi and Dmanisi) that showed high contamination of soil by Pb, mercury and cadmium . This pollution has been associated with industrial activity and pollution of water ."
PMC8635345,2021-12-01,The transmission of drug-resistant strains of HIV in heterosexual populations based on genetic sequences," China’s National Free Antiretroviral Treatment Program (NFATP) has substantially reduced morbidity and HIV/AIDS incidence since 2003. However, HIV resistance to antiretroviral drugs (ARVs) has been a major challenge for the current treatment of HIV/AIDS in China. METHODS In the current study, we established a nested dynamic model to predict the multi-drug resistance dynamics of HIV among the heterosexual population and evaluated the impact of intervention measures on the transmission of drug resistance. We obtained an effective reproductive number [Image see text] from each sub-model held at different stages of the dynamic model. Meanwhile, we applied Bayesian phylogenetic methods to infer the weighted average effective reproductive number [Image see text] from four HIV subtypes that sampled from 912 HIV-positive patients in China. It is an original and innovative method by fitting [Image see text] to [Image see text] by Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) to generate unknown parameters in [Image see text] . RESULTS By analyzing the HIV gene sequences, we inferred that the most recent common ancestor of CRF01AE, CRF07BC, CRF08BC, and CRFBC dated from 1994, 1990, 1993 and 1990, respectively. The weighted average effective reproductive number [Image see text] dropped from 1.95 in 1994 to 1.73 in 2018. Considering different interventions, we used a macro dynamic model to predict the trend of HIV resistance. The results show that the number of new infections and total drug resistance under the baseline parameter (S) are 253,422 and 213,250 in 2025, respectively. Comparing with the numbers under the target treatment rate (S), they were 219,717 and 236,890, respectively. However, under the ideal treatment target (S, the treatment rate reaches 90% and the treatment success rate reaches 90%), the number of new infections shows a declining trend and will decrease to 46,559 by 2025. Compared with S and S, the total number of resistance also decreased to 160,899 in 2025. CONCLUSION With the promotion of NFATP in China, HIV resistance to ARVs is inevitable. The strategy of increasing the treatment rate would not only ineffectively curb the epidemic, but also deteriorate drug resistance issue. Whereas, a combination of intervention strategies (the treatment rate reaches 90% and the treatment success rate reaches 90%) can greatly reduce both infection and drug resistance rate than applying one strategy alone.","Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS) is one of the biggest threats to public health in the world. Although the Chinese government has made great efforts in preventing and controlling the epidemic, the current situation is concerning . Currently, heterosexual transmission is the main route of HIV/AIDS transmission in China. According to the most recent report from the China CDC, heterosexual transmission accounted for 73.7% of the new HIV/AIDS infections from January to October 2019 . To effectively curb the HIV/AIDS epidemic in China, the Chinese government has implemented “Four Frees and One Care” policy since 2003 [3, 4] provide free highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) for HIV infected individuals who are eligible for treatment. The promotion of HAART has significantly reduced morbidity, mortality, transmission and new infections of HIV/AIDS [5, 6]. However, increasing the treatment rate also led to an increase in the spread of various HIV-resistant strains, which is the main reason for the failure of antiretroviral therapy (ART) and becomes a major challenge in HIV/AIDS treatment . Growing evidence shows that HIV drug resistance is rising rapidly in China, which greatly hindered the efforts made by the government and health professionals [8–10]. Therefore, understanding the transmission of HIV resistance among heterosexuals can provide important direction for future ART programs."
PMC8638996,2021-12-02,"Epidemiology of Schistosoma mansoni infection in Ituri Province, north-eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo"," Schistosomiasis, caused by Schistosoma mansoni, is of great significance to public health in sub–Saharan Africa. In the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), information on the burden of S. mansoni infection is scarce, which hinders the implementation of adequate control measures. We assessed the geographical distribution of S. mansoni infection across Ituri province in north-eastern DRC and determined the prevailing risk factors. METHODS/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS Two province–wide, community–based studies were conducted. In 2016, a geographical distribution study was carried out in 46 randomly selected villages across Ituri. In 2017, an in–depth study was conducted in 12 purposively–selected villages, across the province. Households were randomly selected, and members were enrolled. In 2016, one stool sample was collected per participant, while in 2017, several samples were collected per participant. S. mansoni eggs were detected using the Kato–Katz technique. In 2017, a point–of–care circulating cathodic S. mansoni antigen (POC–CCA) urine test was the second used diagnostic approach. Household and individual questionnaires were used to collect data on demographic, socioeconomic, environmental, behavioural and knowledge risk factors. Of the 2,131 participants in 2016, 40.0% were positive of S. mansoni infection. Infection prevalence in the villages ranged from 0 to 90.2%. Of the 707 participants in 2017, 73.1% were tested positive for S. mansoni. Prevalence ranged from 52.8 to 95.0% across the health districts visited. Infection prevalence increased from north to south and from west to east. Exposure to the waters of Lake Albert and the villages’ altitude above sea level were associated with the distribution. Infection prevalence and intensity peaked in the age groups between 10 and 29 years. Preschool children were highly infected (62.3%). Key risk factors were poor housing structure (odds ratio [OR] 2.1, 95% 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.02–4.35), close proximity to water bodies (OR 1.72, 95% CI 1.1–2.49), long-term residence in a community (OR 1.41, 95% CI 1.11–1.79), lack of latrine in the household (OR 2.00, 95% CI 1.11–3.60), and swimming (OR 2.53, 95% CI 1.20–5.32) and washing (OR 1.75, 95% CI 1.10–2.78) in local water bodies. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE Our results show that S. mansoni is highly endemic and a major health concern in Ituri province, DRC. Infection prevalence and intensity, and the prevailing socioeconomic, environmental, and behavioural risk factors in Ituri reflect intense exposure and alarming transmission rates. A robust plan of action is urgently needed in the province.","Schistosomiasis is a major cause of global disability, morbidity, and mortality [1, 2]. Recent estimates suggest that nearly 800 million people are at risk for schistosomiasis, while 240 million people are infected —more than 90% of whom live in sub–Saharan Africa (SSA) . Population-based preventive chemotherapy (PCT) using praziquantel (PZQ) is the recommended control strategy . Schistosomiasis is a water-borne parasitic disease caused by trematode species of the genus Schistosoma. In SSA, there are four predominant species, namely S. mansoni, which causes intestinal schistosomiasis; S. haematobium, the agent of genitourinary schistosomiasis; S. intercalatum; and S. guineensis . Schistosoma species exhibit an indirect life cycle with one intermediate host. Parasite eggs are released into the environment (i.e., local water bodies) via the stools or urine of infected people. Transmission of the parasite during its infective stages is multifactorial and depends on the environment, parasite, vector, and host . Human water contact patterns critically influence transmission and are associated with the socio-economic and behavioural characteristics of a local population, such as lack of proper sanitation, limited access to safe water, and poor hygiene (WaSH)."
PMC8685678,2021-12-07,Entropy-regularized deconvolution of cellular cryotransmission electron tomograms,"Cryo-electron tomography (cryo-ET) allows for the high-resolution visualization of biological macromolecules. However, the technique is limited by a low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and variance in contrast at different frequencies, as well as reduced Z resolution. Here, we applied entropy-regularized deconvolution (ER-DC) to cryo-ET data generated from transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and reconstructed using weighted back projection (WBP). We applied deconvolution to several in situ cryo-ET datasets and assessed the results by Fourier analysis and subtomogram analysis (STA).","The key to a meaningful deconvolution is that the synthetic PSF should represent as closely as possible the 3D image of an ideal point source. In the case of TEM, this requires an accounting for the defocus imposed in the image acquisition, which is customarily expressed in terms of a CTF. The 3D PSF for deconvolution was computed from simulated projections of a point source with the same dimensions and pixel spacing as the aligned tilt series (Fig. 2A). The CTF was first convolved with a projected point source (Fig. 2B), and then, a synthetic tilt series was reconstructed to the same dimensions as the original tomogram using the tilt angles represented in the corresponding reconstruction (Fig. 2C). This is the real-space PSF, whose 3D fast Fourier transform (FFT) serves as the optical transfer function, or kernel, for the deconvolution (Fig. 2D). The 2D CTFs vary with the gradient of defocus for each micrograph in the tilt series. As a first demonstration of cryo-ET deconvolution, we used a human embryonic kidney (HEK) cell cultured on grid that had been FIB milled to 150-nm thickness. The reconstructed volume contains membranes, microtubules, and a prominent crystalline protein array. The cells were overexpressing human Parkinson’s-related protein LRRK2-I2020T , and the observed repetitive structure is likely an autophagosome, given its double-lipid bilayer structure . Contrast is sharp in slices through the XY plane of the tomogram, as expected (blue plane midstructure in Fig. 3B), but contrast and resolution in the Z direction, seen in a slice through the XZ plane (orthogonal green plane in midstructure in Fig. 3C), are severely compromised. Furthermore, the reconstructed volume displays a signal both above and below the specimen when observed in the XZ plane. Since the milled slab of material is finite in the Z direction and the sample is imaged in a vacuum, there should be negligible intensity outside the sample volume in the reconstructed data. This is a known artifact of WBP. These image distortions in real space can also be characterized in Fourier space, where the real-space dimensions (x,y,z) correspond to the Fourier dimensions (Kx,Ky,Kz). The protein array in the real-space XY plane appears as a lattice of calculated diffraction spots in the plane (Kx, Ky), as expected (Fig. 3E). In the XZ plane, the lattice of spots is sharply truncated at the Fourier planes normal to the limits of the acquired tilts. In summary, WBP suffers from major distortions visible in both real and Fourier space."
PMC8691407,2021-12-20,Predictors to Use Mobile Apps for Monitoring COVID-19 Symptoms and Contact Tracing: Survey Among Dutch Citizens," eHealth apps have been recognized as a valuable tool to reduce COVID-19’s effective reproduction number. The factors that determine the acceptance of COVID-19 apps remain unknown. The exception here is privacy. OBJECTIVE The aim of this article was to identify antecedents of acceptance of  a mobile app for COVID-19 symptom recognition and monitoring and  a mobile app for contact tracing, both by means of an online survey among Dutch citizens. METHODS Next to the demographics, the online survey contained questions focusing on perceived health, fear of COVID-19, and intention to use. We used snowball sampling via posts on social media and personal connections. To identify antecedents of the model for acceptance of the 2 mobile apps, we conducted multiple linear regression analyses. RESULTS In total, 238 Dutch adults completed the survey; 59.2% (n=141) of the responders were female and the average age was 45.6 years (SD 17.4 years). For the symptom app, the final model included the predictors age, attitude toward technology, and fear of COVID-19. The model had an r2 of 0.141. The final model for the tracing app included the same predictors and had an r2 of 0.156. The main reason to use both mobile apps was to control the spread of the COVID-19 virus. Concerns about privacy was mentioned as the main reason to not use the mobile apps. CONCLUSIONS Age, attitude toward technology, and fear of COVID-19 are important predictors of the acceptance of COVID-19 mobile apps for symptom recognition and monitoring and for contact tracing. These predictors should be taken into account during the development and implementation of these mobile apps to secure acceptance.","It is spring 2020 and the COVID-19 pandemic has the world in its grip. Infection with COVID-19 can lead to a simple cold or no symptoms at all, while it can also rapidly develop into a life-threatening disease, especially for patients with existing cardiovascular problems, obesity, or diabetes . To hamper the spread of COVID-19 and to manage the intensive care unit capacity, many countries have applied a lockdown strategy for their citizens . In order to control the spread of COVID-19 after a lockdown, and to minimize the effective reproduction number of the disease, several measures can be applied, of which social distancing, combined with aggressive case finding and isolation, seems to be the most effective . eHealth apps have been recognized as a valuable tool for supporting symptom recognition and monitoring , for contact tracing , and ultimately, for reducing COVID-19’s effective reproduction number by means of timely intervention. In short, a contact tracing app would record a citizen’s contacts with other people via Bluetooth technology and, in the case of a COVID-19 infection, will warn the persons that the index patient recently had contact with so that they can apply self-isolation and be attentive for any COVID-19 symptoms. However, for such apps to be effective, high uptake among the population is necessary. For the case of a tracing app, it has been estimated that 56% of a country’s population should use the app to suppress the epidemic . It is therefore crucial that the design of these apps and the implementation strategies that accompany them take the factors that affect acceptance into account."
PMC8721154,2022-01-03,"Pyronaridine–artesunate or dihydroartemisinin–piperaquine combined with single low-dose primaquine to prevent Plasmodium falciparum malaria transmission in Ouélessébougou, Mali: a four-arm, single-blind, phase 2/3, randomised trial"," Pyronaridine–artesunate is the most recently licensed artemisinin-based combination therapy. WHO has recommended that a single low dose of primaquine could be added to artemisinin-based combination therapies to reduce Plasmodium falciparum transmission in areas aiming for elimination of malaria or areas facing artemisinin resistance. We aimed to determine the efficacy of pyronaridine–artesunate and dihydroartemisinin–piperaquine with and without single low-dose primaquine for reducing gametocyte density and transmission to mosquitoes. METHODS We conducted a four-arm, single-blind, phase 2/3, randomised trial at the Ouélessébougou Clinical Research Unit of the Malaria Research and Training Centre of the University of Bamako (Bamako, Mali). Participants were aged 5–50 years, with asymptomatic P falciparum malaria mono-infection and gametocyte carriage on microscopy, haemoglobin density of 9·5 g/dL or higher, bodyweight less than 80 kg, and no use of antimalarial drugs over the past week. Participants were randomly assigned  to one of four treatment groups pyronaridine–artesunate, pyronaridine–artesunate plus primaquine, dihydroartemisinin–piperaquine, or dihydroartemisinin–piperaquine plus primaquine. Treatment allocation was concealed to all study staff other than the trial pharmacist and treating physician. Dihydroartemisinin–piperaquine and pyronaridine–artesunate were administered as per manufacturer guidelines over 3 days; primaquine was administered as a single dose in oral solution according to bodyweight (0·25 mg/kg; in 1 kg bands). The primary endpoint was percentage reduction in mosquito infection rate (percentage of mosquitoes surviving to dissection that were infected with P falciparum) at 48 h after treatment compared with baseline (before treatment) in all treatment groups. Data were analysed per protocol. This trial is now complete, and is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04049916. FINDINGS Between Sept 10 and Nov 19, 2019, 1044 patients were assessed for eligibility and 100 were enrolled and randomly assigned to one of the four treatment groups (n=25 per group). Before treatment, 66 (66%) of 100 participants were infectious to mosquitoes, with a median of 15·8% (IQR 5·4–31·9) of mosquitoes becoming infected. In individuals who were infectious before treatment, the median percentage reduction in mosquito infection rate 48 h after treatment was 100·0% (IQR 100·0 to 100·0) for individuals treated with pyronaridine–artesunate plus primaquine (n=18; p<0·0001) and dihydroartemisinin–piperaquine plus primaquine (n=15; p=0·0001), compared with −8·7% (−54·8 to 93·2) with pyronaridine–artesunate (n=17; p=0·88) and 50·4% (13·8 to 70·9) with dihydroartemisinin–piperaquine (n=16; p=0·13). There were no serious adverse events, and there were no significant differences between treatment groups at any point in the frequency of any adverse events (Fisher's exact test p=0·96) or adverse events related to study drugs (p=0·64). The most common adverse events were headaches (40 events in 32 [32%] of 100 participants), rhinitis (31 events in 30 [30%]), and respiratory infection (20 events in 20 [20%]). INTERPRETATION These data support the use of single low-dose primaquine as an effective supplement to dihydroartemisinin–piperaquine and pyronaridine–artesunate for blocking P falciparum transmission. The new pyronaridine–artesunate plus single low-dose primaquine combination is of immediate relevance to regions in which the containment of partial artemisinin and partner-drug resistance is a growing concern and in regions aiming to eliminate malaria.

Drugs are a key component of malaria control strategies and yet, outside of mass drug administration,1 the gametocytocidal component of treatment receives little attention. The addition of gametocytocidal drugs to first-line malaria treatments could benefit control efforts, expedite elimination, and slow the spread of parasite strains that are resistant to standard schizonticides.2 Pyronaridine–artesunate is a recommended treatment for uncomplicated Plasmodium falciparum malaria in all malaria endemic regions.3 As the most recently licensed artemisinin-based combination therapy (ACT), pyronaridine–artesunate is being adopted in areas where the efficacy of current first-line and second-line drugs is decreasing.4 ACT treatment failures are associated with higher gametocyte prevalence.5 Regardless of clinical treatment outcome, ACTs have low activity against mature, transmissible gametocytes.6 Patients treated with artemether–lumefantrine or dihydroartemisinin–piperaquine can still harbour infectious gametocytes and these can persist after treatment.7 The duration of gametocyte infectivity to mosquitoes following ACT treatment is so far poorly defined and has not been assessed beyond the first week after treatment. Primaquine has potent gametocytocidal activity, with studies showing that a single low dose of 0·25 mg/kg is sufficient to neutralise infectivity to mosquitoes within 48 h.8, 9 This dose is considered safe in individuals deficient in glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD), who are at risk of transient haemolysis after treatment with oxidative compounds including primaquine.10 WHO currently recommends treatment with ACT and single low-dose primaquine without G6PD testing to prevent onward P falciparum transmission in areas of artemisinin drug resistance or areas aiming for malaria elimination.11 Given that data from Rwanda have confirmed the de novo emergence of kelch13 mutations and associated delayed clearance of parasites,12, 13 novel ACTs and transmission-reducing measures, such as single low-dose primaquine, could be important components of efforts to avert a public health emergency.2"
PMC8743744,2022-01-10,Silica nanoparticles with encapsulated DNA (SPED) to trace the spread of pathogens in healthcare," To establish effective infection control protocols, understanding pathogen transmission pathways is essential. Non-infectious surrogate tracers may safely explore these pathways and challenge pre-existing assumptions. We used silica nanoparticles with encapsulated DNA (SPED) for the first time in a real-life hospital setting to investigate potential transmission routes of vancomycin-resistant enterococci in the context of a prolonged outbreak. METHODS The two study experiments took place in the 900-bed University Hospital Zurich, Switzerland. A three-run ‘Patient experiment’ investigated pathogen transmission via toilet seats in a two-patient room with shared bathroom. First, various predetermined body and fomite sites in a two-bed patient room were probed at baseline. Then, after the first patient was contaminated with SPED at the subgluteal region, both patients sequentially performed a toilet routine. All sites were consequently swabbed again for SPED contamination. Eight hours later, further spread was tested at predefined sites in the patient room and throughout the ward. A two-run ‘Mobile device experiment’ explored the potential transmission by mobile phones and stethoscopes in a quasi-realistic setting. All SPED contamination statuses and levels were determined by real-time qPCR. RESULTS Over all three runs, the ‘Patient experiment’ yielded SPED in 59 of 73 (80.8%) predefined body and environmental sites. Specifically, positivity rates were 100% on subgluteal skin, toilet seats, tap handles, and entertainment devices, the initially contaminated patients’ hands; 83.3% on patient phones and bed controls; 80% on intravenous pumps; 75% on toilet flush plates and door handles, and 0% on the initially not contaminated patients’ hands. SPED spread as far as doctor’s keyboards (66.6%), staff mobile phones (33.3%) and nurses’ keyboards (33.3%) after eight hours. The ‘Mobile device experiment’ resulted in 16 of 22 (72.7%) positive follow-up samples, and transmission to the second patient occurred in one of the two runs. CONCLUSIONS For the first time SPED were used to investigate potential transmission pathways in a real hospital setting. The results suggest that, in the absence of targeted cleaning, toilet seats and mobile devices may result in widespread transmission of pathogens departing from one contaminated patient skin region.","Healthcare associated infections (HCAI) cause higher complication and mortality rates, prolonged hospital stays, and increased healthcare costs [1, 2]. Moreover, the spread of antimicrobial resistant pathogens is considered one of the most crucial issues in healthcare . Multiple large-scale outbreaks of vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) in Swiss hospitals in the last decade indicate a surge of VRE in Switzerland [4–6]. Poor hand hygiene (HH) has proven to be a primary cause of pathogen transmission . Guidelines and protocols have been established to improve hand hygiene in healthcare [2, 8] with limited overall success [9, 10]. Several studies published over the past 20 years indicate the effect of contaminated hospital environment on pathogen transmission—especially multi-resistant pathogens such as VRE [11–14]. Pittet et al.  list “organisms shed onto inanimate objects immediately surrounding the patient” as the starting point of cross-transmission between patients. Other studies suggest that the risk for VRE acquisition is higher when a patient stays in a hospital room previously occupied by a VRE-infected patient [15–17]. Lower rates of multi-drug resistant pathogen colonization and infection occur in hospitals with single-rooms and thus, individualized toilet use [18, 19]."

The objective of this study is to characterize the epidemic evolution of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) applying the SIR model (Susceptible-Infectious-recovered or deceased) during a period of 200 days. The time series data of COVID-19 from March 06 to May 14, 2020 of the Peruvian Ministry of Health was used, presenting estimated cases by varying the basic reproduction number R0. According to the SIR model, the peak of those infected occurs shortly after May 30 from the beginning of the epidemic (day 86) where the total number of infected cases decreases to R0 = 1.5. The results suggest that Peru's current stringent measures can effectively prevent the spread of COVID-19 and should be maintained even with efficient results.","La enfermedad del coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) comenzó en Wuhan, China a principios de diciembre de 2019, donde se identificaron los primeros casos de una neumonía de origen desconocido en la capital de la provincia de Hubei-China y rápidamente se extendió en ese país y en muchos países y regiones del mundo1-3. El virus probablemente se originó en un murciélago después de la mutación en la glucoproteína spike, como se sugirió recientemente, adquiriendo la capacidad de infectar a los humanos4.

PMC8782347,2022-01-21,Investigating public support for biosecurity measures to mitigate pathogen transmission through the herpetological trade,"The expanding global trade in herpetofauna has contributed to new infectious disease dynamics and pathways that allow for the rapid spread of pathogens geographically. Improved biosecurity is needed to mitigate adverse biodiversity, economic and human health impacts associated with pathogen transmission through the herpetological trade. However, general lack of knowledge of the pathogen transmission risks associated with the global trade in herpetofauna and public opposition to biosecurity measures are critical obstacles to successfully preventing pathogen transmission. In 2019 we administered a survey to 2,007 members of the public in the United States of America to ascertain their support for interventions to prevent the spread of Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd), Batrachochytrium salamandrivorans (Bsal), ranaviruses, and Salmonella through the herpetological trade. We presented survey respondents with different potential hazards associated with pathogen transmission through this trade, namely ecological, economic, and human health impacts. We used structural equation models to determine how these different hazards and respondents’ characteristics influenced respondents’ support for quarantine and veterinary observation of herpetofauna imported into the United States, mandatory tests for diseases of concern, and best practices to reduce stress and improve the care of live herpetofauna during transport to the United States. Respondents’ values and their perceived susceptibility and sensitivity to different hazards associated with pathogen transmission were key determinants of their support for biosecurity. Respondents with strong biospheric and altruistic values demonstrated sensitivity to ecological and human health impacts associated with pathogen transmission, whereas respondents with strong egoistic values demonstrated sensitivity to economic impacts. Respondents had limited knowledge of Bd, Bsal or ranaviruses, the size of the herpetological trade, or how this trade may contribute to pathogen transmission. Improved outreach and education on pathogen transmission through the herpetological trade is required, but it is important that messages are tailored to people with different values to elicit their support for biosecurity.","Pathogens (e.g., viruses, bacteria, fungi) transmitted through the wildlife trade have received increasing attention in the past 15 years due to the H1N1 (swine flu), H5N1 (bird flu), and SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) outbreaks [1,2]. Wildlife are targets of, and reservoirs for, pathogens that may infect native species, domestic animals, and humans. Wildlife are considered to be the source of at least 70% of all emerging diseases [3,4]. Increasing global trade in wildlife and environmental change have generated new infectious disease dynamics and pathways that allow for the rapid spread of pathogens geographically and between species, thereby threatening biodiversity and animal and public health [3–6]. In this paper we focus on pathogen transmission through the herpetological trade, which has resulted in severe ecological, economic, and human health consequences [7–9]. The fungal pathogens Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd) and Batrachochytrium salamandrivorans (Bsal) cause chytridiomycosis (‘chytrid’), an emerging infectious disease that is considered the leading infectious disease threat to biodiversity [7,8]. Ranaviruses (family Iridoviridae) are widespread, host-unspecific emerging dsDNA viruses that produce systemic infections in amphibians, reptiles, and fish [10,11]. Salmonella bacteria are zoonotic pathogens that cause salmonellosis and are transmitted to poultry, livestock, and humans through direct and indirect contact with herpetofauna [9,12]. Transmission of Bd, Bsal, ranaviruses and Salmonella has been exacerbated by the trade in herpetofauna [5,10,13]."
PMC8798051,2022-01-28,Primate malarias as a model for cross-species parasite transmission,"Parasites regularly switch into new host species, representing a disease burden and conservation risk to the hosts. The distribution of these parasites also gives insight into characteristics of ecological networks and genetic mechanisms of host-parasite interactions. Some parasites are shared across many species, whereas others tend to be restricted to hosts from a single species. Understanding the mechanisms producing this distribution of host specificity can enable more effective interventions and potentially identify genetic targets for vaccines or therapies. As ecological connections between human and local animal populations increase, the risk to human and wildlife health from novel parasites also increases. Which of these parasites will fizzle out and which have the potential to become widespread in humans? We consider the case of primate malarias, caused by Plasmodium parasites, to investigate the interacting ecological and evolutionary mechanisms that put human and nonhuman primates at risk for infection. Plasmodium host switching from nonhuman primates to humans led to ancient introductions of the most common malaria-causing agents in humans today, and new parasite switching is a growing threat, especially in Asia and South America. Based on a wild host-Plasmodium occurrence database, we highlight geographic areas of concern and potential areas to target further sampling. We also discuss methodological developments that will facilitate clinical and field-based interventions to improve human and wildlife health based on this eco-evolutionary perspective.","Animals host an incredible diversity of parasites, here defined as organisms that live in or on another organism (the host) at some cost to the host, including microparasites (viruses, bacteria, fungi, and protozoa) and macroparasites (helminths and arthropods). Science is only just starting to understand this diversity of parasites, with the vast majority of parasites yet to be documented (Dobson et al., 2008; Poulin et al., 2016; Carlson et al., 2019). Some parasites are highly host specific, meaning that they are found only on a single host species, while others are generalists that are able to infect multiple hosts. Hence, these symbiotic associations and their transmission represent a vast web of connections that can be mapped among host species (Poulin, 2010; Gómez et al., 2013). These associations vary over time as parasites go extinct, speciate, and transmit across host species, with these processes influenced by evolutionary dynamics and geographic movements of the host species themselves (Combes, 2001). Parasites also drive coevolutionary dynamics involving reciprocal selective pressures favoring host defenses and parasite adaptations to overcome those defenses. The factors that drive the connections between hosts and parasites are central to major research programs in ecology and evolution. These associations, and changes to them, also impact human health. In particular, parasites and pathogens can shift to human populations (a zoonosis) and adapt to humans, in some cases evolving to become specialists on humans (Wolfe et al., 2007), as seen with HIV-AIDS, measles virus, and the malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum. Given the massive and global extent of anthropogenic change and its impacts on disease-carrying hosts (Gibb et al., 2020), such events are likely to occur increasingly often. Cross-species transmission events are also important to animal health and conservation, with parasites having negative fitness consequences for animal hosts and contributing to extinctions (De Castro and Bolker, 2004). Many of these negative outcomes result from cross-species transmissions from domesticated animals, invasive species, or humans (known as anthropozoonoses in the latter case). Finally, the loss of a host causes loss of parasites (Koh et al., 2004; Dobson et al., 2008; Dunn et al., 2009; Herrera et al., 2021). Given the important role of parasites in ecosystems, the loss of hosts can have cascading effects, with some authors proposing using naturally occurring parasites as a marker of a healthy ecosystem (Hudson et al., 2006)."
PMC8806182,2021-12-23,Structural basis of malaria transmission blockade by a monoclonal antibody to gamete fusogen HAP2,"HAP2 is a transmembrane gamete fusogen found in multiple eukaryotic kingdoms and is structurally homologous to viral class II fusogens. Studies in Plasmodium have suggested that HAP2 is an attractive target for vaccines that block transmission of malaria. HAP2 has three extracellular domains, arranged in the order D2, D1, and D3. Here, we report monoclonal antibodies against the D3 fragment of Plasmodium berghei HAP2 and crystal structures of D3 in complex with Fab fragments of two of these antibodies, one of which blocks fertilization of Plasmodium berghei in vitro and transmission of malaria in mosquitoes. We also show how this Fab binds the complete HAP2 ectodomain with electron microscopy. The two antibodies cross-react with HAP2 among multiple plasmodial species. Our characterization of the Plasmodium D3 structure, HAP2 ectodomain architecture, and mechanism of inhibition provide insights for the development of a vaccine to block malaria transmission.","HAP2, a gamete fusogen required for fertilization, is found in eukaryotic plant, metazoan, and protozoan kingdoms (Clark, 2018). Crystal structures are known of HAP2 from the unicellular green alga, Chlamydomonas reinhardti; a model plant, Arabidopsis thaliana; and a protozoan parasite, Trypanosoma cruzi (Fédry et al., 2017; Feng et al., 2018; Fedry et al., 2018; Baquero et al., 2019). HAP2 can form a trimeric structure that is structurally homologous to the fusion state of viral class II fusion proteins. These fusogens have three extracellular domains, arranged in the order D2, D1, and D3, a disordered stem region, a single-pass transmembrane domain, and a cytoplasmic domain, and are expressed on the plasma membrane of male gametes or the envelope of viruses (Figure 1). HAP2 is required for fertilization in Plasmodium parasites (Hirai et al., 2008; Liu et al., 2008) and is thus an attractive target for vaccines that block transmission of malaria. Gamete fertilization takes place in the mosquito midgut in a blood meal taken from an infected individual. Blocking fertilization prevents transmission to the individual from which the mosquito takes its second, final blood meal. Plasmodium gametes emerge from infected erythrocytes well before digestion of the blood meal; specific antibodies present in the blood meal will react with and can agglutinate or otherwise neutralize gametes (Angrisano et al., 2017; Blagborough and Sinden, 2009; Qiu et al., 2020; Graves et al., 1985). HAP2 is present on male gametes (microgametes) and has hydrophobic fusion loops at the tip of D2 that insert into the plasma membrane of the female macrogamete and trigger trimerization and structural rearrangements of HAP2 to the fusion state, which mediates membrane fusion and merging of the cytoplasm of the two gametes through a fusion pore (Kielian and Rey, 2006; Figure 1). To mediate fusion, D3 of HAP2 folds over an inner trimeric core composed of D1 and D2 (Figure 1). We reasoned that antibodies to D3 of HAP2 that blocked the interface formed with D1 and D2 in the fusion state might block fusion, as has been demonstrated with viral fusogens (Austin et al., 2012; Zhao et al., 2016; Li et al., 2018). Thus, we hypothesized that HAP2 D3 antibody taken up in a blood meal could inhibit fertilization and infection of the mosquito and subsequent transmission to humans (Delves et al., 2018; Figure 1)."
PMC8836367,2022-01-20,Fine-scale estimation of effective reproduction numbers for dengue surveillance,"The effective reproduction number R(t) is an epidemiological quantity that provides an instantaneous measure of transmission potential of an infectious disease. While dengue is an increasingly important vector-borne disease, few have used R(t) as a measure to inform public health operations and policy for dengue. This study demonstrates the utility of R(t) for real time dengue surveillance. Using nationally representative, geo-located dengue case data from Singapore over 2010–2020, we estimated R(t) by modifying methods from Bayesian (EpiEstim) and filtering (EpiFilter) approaches, at both the national and local levels. We conducted model assessment of R(t) from each proposed method and determined exogenous temporal and spatial drivers for R(t) in relation to a wide range of environmental and anthropogenic factors. At the national level, both methods achieved satisfactory model performance (R(EpiEstim) = 0.95, R(EpiFilter) = 0.97), but disparities in performance were large at finer spatial scales when case counts are low (MASE (EpiEstim) = 1.23, MASE(EpiFilter) = 0.59). Impervious surfaces and vegetation with structure dominated by human management (without tree canopy) were positively associated with increased transmission intensity. Vegetation with structure dominated by human management (with tree canopy), on the other hand, was associated with lower dengue transmission intensity. We showed that dengue outbreaks were preceded by sustained periods of high transmissibility, demonstrating the potential of R(t) as a dengue surveillance tool for detecting large rises in dengue cases. Real time estimation of R(t) at the fine scale can assist public health agencies in identifying high transmission risk areas and facilitating localised outbreak preparedness and response.","Dengue is an arboviral disease that imposes significant health and economic burdens across the globe . It is transmitted by Aedes mosquitoes, primarily the highly urban-adapted vector Aedes aegypti . Increased levels of urbanization, human population density and climate change have led to an expanded geographical coverage of the primary vector Ae. aegypti, resulting in an estimated annual 105 million dengue infections globally . The burden of dengue is high, particularly in the tropics and subtropics where vector breeding conditions are favourable, and transmission persists year-round [4–6]. Located within Southeast-Asia, Singapore is a highly urbanised island city-state with a tropical climate conducive for Aedes mosquito breeding and dengue transmission . Singapore faces regular dengue outbreaks with all four dengue serotypes co-circulating all year round . Although dengue vaccine, Dengvaxia (CYD-TDV), has been made available commercially since 2017, its efficacy against different serotypes varies and administering it may increase the risk of severe dengue disease in individuals who have not been previously infected. The vaccine is thus safe for use only on individuals with previous dengue infections . As a result, community-based vector control remains the key strategy to mitigate dengue transmission in Singapore . However, vector control activities are often resource and labour intensive, and critically require early warning systems for pre-epidemic preparedness and efficient vector control deployment ."
PMC8816380,2022-02-04,Widespread discrepancy in Nnt genotypes and genetic backgrounds complicates granzyme A and other knockout mouse studies,"Granzyme A (GZMA) is a serine protease secreted by cytotoxic lymphocytes, with Gzma(-/-) mouse studies having informed our understanding of GZMA’s physiological function. We show herein that Gzma(-/-) mice have a mixed C57BL/6J and C57BL/6N genetic background and retain the full-length nicotinamide nucleotide transhydrogenase (Nnt) gene, whereas Nnt is truncated in C57BL/6J mice. Chikungunya viral arthritis was substantially ameliorated in Gzma(-/-) mice; however, the presence of Nnt and the C57BL/6N background, rather than loss of GZMA expression, was responsible for this phenotype. A new CRISPR active site mutant C57BL/6J Gzma(S211A) mouse provided the first insights into GZMA’s bioactivity free of background issues, with circulating proteolytically active GZMA promoting immune-stimulating and pro-inflammatory signatures. Remarkably, k-mer mining of the Sequence Read Archive illustrated that ≈27% of Run Accessions and ≈38% of BioProjects listing C57BL/6J as the mouse strain had Nnt sequencing reads inconsistent with a C57BL/6J genetic background. Nnt and C57BL/6N background issues have clearly complicated our understanding of GZMA and may similarly have influenced studies across a broad range of fields.","Granzyme A (GZMA) is a granule trypsin-like serine protease (trypase) secreted by cytotoxic lymphocytes such as NK cells (Fehniger et al., 2007; Wu et al., 2019), NKT cells (Gordy et al., 2011), and CD8+ cytotoxic T lymphocytes (Suhrbier et al., 1991). The traditional view has been that GZMA is a cytotoxic mediator that is secreted into the immunological synapse, entering the target cell via perforin pores, whereupon certain cytoplasmic proteins are cleaved, resulting in the initiation of cell death pathway(s) (Liesche et al., 2018; Martinvalet et al., 2008; Wu et al., 2019; Zhou et al., 2020). A key tool in the quest to understand the physiological role of GZMA has been the use of Gzma-/- mice (Ebnet et al., 1995). For instance, control of viral infections can be compromised in Gzma-/- mice (Loh et al., 2004; Müllbacher et al., 1996; Pereira et al., 2000; Riera et al., 2000), with cytotoxic lymphocytes from these mice reported to be less able to kill target cells (Pardo et al., 2002; Pardo et al., 2004; Shresta et al., 1999; Susanto et al., 2013). Like granzyme B (GzmB), GZMA has thus been classified as a cytotoxic granzyme (Golstein and Griffiths, 2018; Mpande et al., 2018; Muraro et al., 2017; Zhou et al., 2020), although in several studies a role for GZMA in mediating cellular cytotoxicity was not observed (Ebnet et al., 1995; Joeckel and Bird, 2014; Regner et al., 2009; Regner et al., 2011; Smyth et al., 2003). In a range of settings, GZMA has also been associated with the promotion of inflammation, providing an additional or alternative view of its physiological role, although consensus on mechanisms has remained elusive (Metkar et al., 2008; Park et al., 2020; Santiago et al., 2020; Santiago et al., 2017; Schanoski et al., 2019; Shimizu et al., 2019; van Daalen et al., 2020; Wensink et al., 2015; Wilson et al., 2017), with a number of potential intracellular and extracellular targets for GZMA reported. These include pro-IL-1β (Hildebrand et al., 2014), SET complex proteins (Mandrup-Poulsen, 2017; Mollah et al., 2017), gasdermin B (Zhou et al., 2020), mitochondrial complex I protein NDUFS3 (Martinvalet et al., 2008), protease activated receptors (Hansen et al., 2005; Sower et al., 1996; Suidan et al., 1994; Suidan et al., 1996), TLR2/4 (van Eck et al., 2017), and TLR9 (Shimizu et al., 2019). Gzma-/- mice have also been used to show a role for GZMA in inter alia diabetes (Mollah et al., 2017), cancer (Santiago et al., 2020), bacterial infections (García-Laorden et al., 2016; García-Laorden et al., 2017; van den Boogaard et al., 2016), and arthritis (Santiago et al., 2017). GZMA’s bioactivity has generally (Plasman et al., 2014; Schanoski et al., 2019; Zhou et al., 2020), but not always (Shimizu et al., 2019; van Eck et al., 2017), been associated with GZMA’s protease activity, with circulating GZMA in humans shown to be proteolytically active (Spaeny-Dekking et al., 1998). After infection with the arthritogenic alphavirus, chikungunya virus (CHIKV) (Suhrbier, 2019), infected Gzma-/- mice showed a substantially reduced overt arthritic foot swelling when compared to infected C57BL/6J (6J) mice (Wilson et al., 2017). However, we show herein that active site mutant GzmaS211A mice generated by CRISPR on a 6J background showed no significant differences in CHIKV arthritic foot swelling when compared with 6J mice. The apparent contradiction was resolved when it emerged that Gzma-/- mice had a mixed 6J and C57BL/6N (6N) background. Gzma-/- mice retained expression of the full-length nicotinamide nucleotide transhydrogenase (Nnt) gene, whereas 6J mice have a truncated Nnt with a 5 exon deletion (Fontaine and Davis, 2016). The presence of full-length Nnt and the mixed 6N/6J genetic background (rather than absence of GZMA expression) emerged to be responsible for amelioration of CHIKV arthritic foot swelling in Gzma-/- mice. As much of our understanding of the physiological role of GZMA comes from studies in Gzma-/- mice, we used the GzmaS211A mice to gain new insights into GZMA function that were not compromised by genetic background."
PMC8846507,2022-02-15,"Persistence of Schistosoma haematobium transmission among school children and its implication for the control of urogenital schistosomiasis in Lindi, Tanzania"," Despite twelve rounds of school-based preventive chemotherapy for schistosomiasis in endemic areas of Tanzania such as Mtama district, Lindi the burden of Schistosoma haematobium infection has remained highly conceivable due to re-infections. The factors associated with continuity of S.haematobium transmission in Mtama district, Lindi have not been fully established. This study investigated the burden and factors contributing to the ongoing transmission of S.haematobium infection in the endemic district of Mtama, Lindi. METHODS A quantitative cross-sectional survey was carried out among 649 school-age children in the Mtama district to determine the burden and factors associated with continuity of S.haematobium infection transmission. A single urine specimen was obtained from each pupil and tested for macro- and microhaematuria, presence of S.haematobium ova, as well intensity of infection; this was complemented with a survey of Bulinus spp snail intermediate hosts and their infectivity. A structured questionnaire was employed to gather information on individual and environmental risk factors for S.haematobium transmission. Summary statistics were computed for individual variables; while a univariate and multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed to assess the association between risk factors with S.haematobium infection. RESULTS Prevalence of S.haematobium infection by macro- and microhaematuria was 13.1% and 46.2% respectively. The prevalence of S.haematobium ova was 52.7%; intensity of infection was light in 53.1%, and heavy in 46.9%. Snail intermediate hosts were Bulinus globosus and B.nasutus, whose infectivity was 2.2% and 1.3%, respectively. Among the assessed risk factors, long residency (10–13 years) in the area was a significant risk factor for the continuity of S.haematobium transmission (AOR 21.79, 95% CI 1.37–346.4). CONCLUSIONS The observed 52.7% prevalence of S.haematobium infection represents unacceptably high prevalence after 12 rounds of preventive chemotherapy. Therefore, an urgent need for the implementation of integrated multiple control interventions in the Mtama district; is considered to be imperative.","Urogenital schistosomiasis is an acute and chronic parasitic disease caused by blood flukes known as Schistosoma haematobium (S. haematobium), which resides in the vasculature surrounding the urogenital system [1,2]. The disease is among the major public health problem in tropical and subtropical countries, especially where there is an inadequate supply of safe water (piped water), poor sanitation, and unhygienic practices such as open urination [3,4]. In endemic areas, the vulnerable population includes pre-school-aged children, school-aged children, and adults engaging in water contact occupations . The infected children are at higher risk of poor cognitive function, poor growth, malnutrition, iron deficiency anemia, reduced school performance, and the development of hepatosplenic morbidities . For transmission of urogenital schistosomiasis to occur, there must be contamination of the freshwater sources with viable S.haematobium eggs, presence of freshwater snails of the Bulinus species (spp), which serves as the intermediate host for the development of the cercariae, and human water contact, which expose them to the infective stage . Globally, approximately 436 million people in 78 countries live in endemic areas that put them at risk of urogenital schistosomiasis, and over 112 million people are infected. Among the infected people, over 103 million suffer haematuria and dysuria, 100 million suffer minor bladder morbidity, 24 million suffer major bladder morbidity, 19 million suffer kidney problems, and 9.6 million have major hydronephrosis due to infection ."
PMC8848679,2022-01-07,"The contribution of unstable housing to HIV and hepatitis C virus transmission among people who inject drugs globally, regionally, and at country level: a modelling study"," A considerable proportion of people who inject drugs are unstably housed. Although unstable housing is associated with HIV and HCV infection among people who inject drugs, its contribution to transmission is unknown. We estimated the global and national proportions of incident HIV and HCV infections among people who inject drugs attributed to housing instability from 2020 to 2029. METHODS In this modelling study, we developed country-level models of unstable housing and HIV and HCV transmission among people who inject drugs in 58 countries globally, calibrated to country-specific data on the prevalences of HIV and HCV and unstable housing. Based on a recently published systematic review, unstably housed people who inject drugs were assumed to have a 39% (95% CI 6–84) increased risk of HIV transmission and a 64% (95% CI 43–89%) increased risk of HCV transmission. We used pooled country-level estimates from systematic reviews on HCV and HIV prevalence in people who inject drugs. Our models estimated the transmission population attributable fraction (tPAF) of unstable housing to HIV and HCV transmission among people who inject drugs, defined as the percentage of infections prevented from 2020 to 2029 if the additional risk due to unstable housing was removed. FINDINGS Our models were produced for 58 countries with sufficient data (accounting for >66% of the global people who inject drugs population). Globally, we project unstable housing contributes 7·9% (95% credibility interval [CrI] 2·3–15·7) of new HIV infections and 11·2% (7·7–15·5) of new HCV infections among people who inject drugs from 2020 to 2029. Country-level tPAFs were strongly associated with the prevalence of unstable housing. tPAFs were greater in high-income countries (HIV 17·2% [95% CrI 5·1–30·0]; HCV 19·4% [95% CrI 13·8–26·0]) than in low-income or middle-income countries (HIV 6·6% [95% CrI 1·8–13·1]; HCV 8·3% [95% CrI 5·5–11·7]). tPAFs for HIV and HCV were highest in Afghanistan, Czech Republic, India, USA, England, and Wales where unstable housing contributed more than 20% of new HIV and HCV infections. INTERPRETATION Unstable housing is an important modifiable risk factor for HIV and HCV transmission among people who inject drugs in many countries. The study emphasises the importance of implementing initiatives to mitigate these risks and reduce housing instability.

unstably housed were on average at 39% (95% CI 6–84) greater risk of
acquiring HIV and 64% (95% CI 43–89%) greater risk of acquiring HCV than
people who inject drugs with stable housing.5 The mechanisms underlying these relationships are probably
multifactorial. Several studies have suggested that the chronic stress associated
with meeting daily survival needs among people experiencing unstable housing can
supersede efforts to reduce HCV and HIV risk.8,9 Unstably housed
people who inject drugs face multiple barriers to accessing medical and harm
reduction services10 and are more
likely to engage in sex work and high-risk injecting behaviours than stably housed
people who inject drugs,11,12 possibly due to the absence of
safe places to store sterile injecting equipment, competing priorities in addition
to injecting safely, and a greater number of injecting partners.8,9
Homelessness has also been linked to HIV outbreaks that occurred during
2011–16 among people who inject drugs in Europe, North America, and
Israel.9 The current study
uses modelling to estimate the global and national proportions (population
attributable fraction [PAF]) of incident HIV and HCV infections attributed to
housing instability among people who inject drugs in 2020–29."
PMC8866381,2022-03-03,Reducing onchocerciasis-associated morbidity in onchocerciasis-endemic foci with high ongoing transmission: a focus on the children.,"Efforts are being directed toward the elimination of onchocerciasis transmission in endemic areas with community-directed treatment with ivermectin (CDTI) in Africa, which greatly reduces onchocerciasis-associated disease. However, onchocerciasis remains a major public health problem in areas of South Sudan, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Cameroon, and the Central African Republic. Strengthening onchocerciasis elimination efforts in areas with a high prevalence of disease burden is crucial to decrease transmission, morbidity, and mortality. We argue that clinical trials are needed to investigate the safety and efficacy of ivermectin treatment of Onchocerca volvulus-infected pregnant women and children younger than 5 years. Crucially, 6-monthly administration of ivermectin in school-age children at risk of onchocerciasis-associated epilepsy could be achieved by supplementing annual CDTI with an extra round of ivermectin treatment during Child Health Days in schools and/or other distribution sites every year. These strategies would help achieve the elimination of onchocerciasis and its associated disease burden.","Onchocerciasis is a neglected tropical disease (NTD) caused by the filarial nematode Onchocerca volvulus and transmitted by way of the bites from (Simulium) blackfly vectors (Brattig et al., 2021). It is estimated that 99% of the 21 million individuals currently infected with O. volvulus live in Africa (Brattig et al., 2021). Onchocerciasis has been typically considered a disease of the skin (itching, onchodermatitis, depigmentation) and the eyes (reduced visual acuity, blindness), mainly affecting adults, but there is increasing evidence that heavy O. volvulus infection in childhood can lead to a wide spectrum of severe developmental disorders in young children. Numerous epidemiological studies have shown a clear association between onchocerciasis and epilepsy, termed “onchocerciasis-associated epilepsy” (OAE) (Colebunders et al., 2021). OAE onset occurs in previously healthy children between the ages of 3–18 years (peaking between 5–12 years), mostly with generalized convulsive seizures (Colebunders et al., 2021). A subset of patients with OEA initially presents with a particular type of atonic head-nodding seizures, the hallmark feature of nodding syndrome (NS) (Idro et al., 2018). Nakalanga syndrome, a childhood disorder mainly characterized by stunting and other characteristic symptoms and signs shared with NS (Foger et al., 2017), is also found in onchocerciasis-endemic areas. Cognitive impairment of varying degrees as an indication of brain disease has been found in these onchocerciasis-related conditions (Colebunders et al., 2021, Foger et al., 2017, Idro et al., 2018). A recent study among 209 children in Cameroon suggested that O. volvulus infection may also lead to cognitive impairment even without manifest epileptic seizures(Siewe Fodjo et al., 2021). Even if children were to acquire the infection at birth, newborn children would not harbor adult O. volvulus worms due to the 1–2-year incubation period. However, the worm's microfilarial progeny can be passed from infected mothers to the fetus by way of the connective tissue of the umbilical cord (Brinkmann et al., 1976) but disappear within several months. In the first year of life, children can become infected from bites of blackfly vectors harboring infective stage L3 larvae, e.g., when carried on the backs of their mothers/siblings as they go to the field. Following infection, they contribute to the perpetuation of the parasite's lifecycle as they become patent with microfilariae in the skin, the stage transmitted from humans to vectors (and mostly associated with clinical manifestations). In highly hyperendemic areas, the prevalence of patent infection can rise from zero in infancy to >60% in children aged 3–9 years, and >80% in those aged 10–14 years (Basáñez and Boussinesq, 1999). Since the pre-patent period is 2–3 years, this indicates that in these areas, children can be exposed from birth. Besides, children born to O. volvulus-infected mothers are more likely to be infected and to harbor higher microfilarial loads(Kirch et al., 2003). This results in a higher risk of developing OAE (Chesnais et al., 2018) and premature mortality (Kaiser et al., 2007)."
PMC8884501,2022-02-28,Improving mathematical modeling of interventions to prevent healthcare-associated infections by interrupting transmission or pathogens: How common modeling assumptions about colonized individuals impact intervention effectiveness estimates,"Mathematical models are used to gauge the impact of interventions for healthcare-associated infections. As with any analytic method, such models require many assumptions. Two common assumptions are that asymptomatically colonized individuals are more likely to be hospitalized and that they spend longer in the hospital per admission because of their colonization status. These assumptions have no biological basis and could impact the estimated effects of interventions in unintended ways. Therefore, we developed a model of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus transmission to explicitly evaluate the impact of these assumptions. We found that assuming that asymptomatically colonized individuals were more likely to be admitted to the hospital or spend longer in the hospital than uncolonized individuals biased results compared to a more realistic model that did not make either assumption. Results were heavily biased when estimating the impact of an intervention that directly reduced transmission in a hospital. In contrast, results were moderately biased when estimating the impact of an intervention that decolonized hospital patients. Our findings can inform choices modelers face when constructing models of healthcare-associated infection interventions and thereby improve their validity.","Healthcare-associated infections (HAIs) impose a substantial burden of disease and can increase healthcare costs considerably [1–5]. However, it is frequently challenging to estimate the effectiveness of prevention measures [6, 7]. Key barriers include the fact that there is generally a low incidence of infections in any one hospital, and therefore individual facilities have little opportunity to quantify the impact of an intervention in a short study. Multicenter studies have been conducted to help address this issue, but their cost can be prohibitive and the length of follow-up can be relatively short [8, 9]. Further complicating the problem, patients transfer between hospitals, nursing homes, other healthcare settings, and the broader community; thus, transmission and symptom onset in non-hospital settings can complicate efforts to evaluate the impacts of hospital-based interventions [7, 10–12]. To address such challenges, investigators sometimes use simulations to help assess whether a previous intervention was effective or whether a new intervention is likely to be successful [13, 14]. Transmission models are relatively inexpensive and quick to create, but require additional assumptions compared to traditional epidemiologic approaches (e.g., randomized trials, cohort studies) [15, 16]. Concerningly, even seemingly innocuous assumptions that are introduced to simplify an analysis have the potential to alter results in ways that modelers did not expect. For instance, modelers often simulate asymptomatically colonized individuals as having higher rates of hospital admission [17, 18] or longer lengths of hospital stay [19–35] compared to uncolonized individuals because they are asymptomatically colonized. While it is true that colonized individuals on average spend more time in hospitals per admission and are more readily admitted, there are likely several confounding factors that can explain the association . For example, people asymptomatically colonized with an HAI causing pathogen tend to be older and sicker than non-carriers . Consequently, a more plausible explanation is that people in poor health are more likely to be hospitalized and to have long lengths of stay, and thereby are more likely to become colonized with a HAI causing pathogen. Reverse causation can also explain some of the crude association between carriage status and length of stay . As a result, transmission models could provide inaccurate estimates of intervention impact when asymptomatic carriage is simulated in these ways."
PMC8892392,2022-03-03,Blood-feeding patterns of Anopheles vectors of human malaria in Malawi: implications for malaria transmission and effectiveness of LLIN interventions," Access to human hosts by Anopheles mosquitoes is a key determinant of vectorial capacity for malaria, but it can be limited by use of long-lasting insecticidal nets (LLINs). In Malawi, pyrethroid-treated LLINs with and without the synergist piperonyl butoxide (PBO) were distributed to control malaria. This study investigated the blood-feeding patterns of malaria vectors and whether LLINs containing pyrethroid and PBO led to a reduction of human blood feeding than those containing only pyrethroids. METHODS Mosquitoes were sampled inside houses from May 2019 through April 2020 by aspiration, pyrethrum spray catch, and light trap methods in two sites. One site (Namanolo, Balaka district) had LLINs containing only pyrethroids whereas the other (Ntaja, Machinga district) had LLINs with both pyrethroids and PBO. Anopheles species, their blood-meal host, and infection with Plasmodium falciparum were determined using PCR methods. RESULTS A total of 6585 female Anopheles were sampled in 203 houses. Of these, 633 (9.6%) were blood-fed mosquitoes comprising of 279 (44.1%) Anopheles arabiensis, 103 (16.3%) Anopheles gambiae 212 (33.5), Anopheles funestus, 2 (0.3%), Anopheles parensis and 37 (5.8%) were unidentified Anopheles spp. Blood meal hosts were successfully identified for 85.5% (n = 541) of the blood-fed mosquitoes, of which 436 (81.0%) were human blood meals, 28 (5.2%) were goats, 11 (2.0%) were dogs, 60 (11.1%) were mixed goat-human blood meals, 5 (0.9%) were dog–human, and 1 was a mixed dog-goat. Human blood index (fraction of blood meals that were humans) was significantly higher in Namanolo (0.96) than Ntaja (0.89). Even though human blood index was high, goats were over-selected than humans after accounting for relative abundance of both hosts. The number of infectious Anopheles bites per person-year was 44 in Namanolo and 22 in Ntaja. CONCLUSION Although LLINs with PBO PBO may have reduced human blood feeding, access to humans was extremely high despite high LLIN ownership and usage rates in both sites. This finding could explain persistently high rates of malaria infections in Malawi. However, this study had one village for each net type, thus the observed differences may have been a result of other factors present in each village. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION The online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1186/s12936-022-04089-7.","Malaria is endemic in Malawi with transmission occurring throughout the country, having generally greater transmission in the south than the north [1–3]. The nation-wide prevalence of infection for Plasmodium falciparum among 2 to 10 year old individuals, sampled from 2010 to 2017, declined from 29.4% in 2010 to 15.2% in 2017 but this change was uneven across the country’s 28 jurisdictional districts . Despite these successes, which are largely attributed to reduction in transmission owing to the implementation of long-lasting insecticidal nets (LLINs) distributed throughout the country, Malawi remains a high malaria burden country with meso-endemic transmission . In 2017, the country-wide incidence of malaria was 247 per 1000, with an estimated 7077 deaths . One of the drivers of Plasmodium transmission is access to human blood meals by host-seeking female Anopheles mosquitoes. The level of access to human hosts is indicated by the relative proportion of human blood meals in a sample of blood-fed mosquitoes, often referred to as the human blood index (HBI). Therefore, selection of different vertebrate host species including humans for blood meals by Anopheles is a key determinant of vectorial capacity—a measure of malaria transmission—because it increases with HBI . HBI is likely to be affected by use of different types of LLINs whose effectiveness is impacted by the extent of insecticide resistance in the Anopheles populations, and the relative availability of hosts [7, 8]. When vectors are susceptible to the pyrethroid insecticide used to treat the nets, HBI is reduced when LLINs are used. This happens because LLINs serve as barriers, preventing mosquitoes from accessing human hosts and also by killing those proportion of the mosquitoes that attempt to feed on humans sleeping under the nets. In contrast, those that feed on animals are not affected, resulting in higher animal blood-meal frequency. However, when pyrethroid resistance emerges in the vector populations, those mosquitoes that seek human hosts under the nets are not killed by the LLINs but live and acquire human blood meals from exposed humans (e.g., during times when humans are not under nets). Thus, insecticide resistance helps to increase the HBI, which means more humans are vulnerable to vector bites. Although the level of insecticide resistance was not investigated in this study, other studies have shown high level of pyrethroid resistance in the vector populations in the two study sites investigated here . This has the potential to severely compromise the LLIN-based malaria control effort in Malawi because it would increase the likelihood of mosquito contact with human hosts. However, newer LLINs which combine pyrethroids with a synergist, piperonyl butoxide (PBO), have shown to be effective at restoring pyrethroid susceptibility [10, 11]. Despite presence of pyrethroid resistance in vector populations, the presence of LLINs with PBO, would decrease the HBI as the mosquito’s survival and access to human hosts is reduced."
PMC8904165,2022-03-09,Naturally acquired antibody kinetics against Plasmodium vivax antigens in people from a low malaria transmission region in western Thailand," Plasmodium vivax (P. vivax) is the dominant Plasmodium spp. causing the disease malaria in low-transmission regions outside of Africa. These regions often feature high proportions of asymptomatic patients with sub-microscopic parasitaemia and relapses. Naturally acquired antibody responses are induced after Plasmodium infection, providing partial protection against high parasitaemia and clinical episodes. However, previous work has failed to address the presence and maintenance of such antibody responses to P. vivax particularly in low-transmission regions. METHODS We followed 34 patients in western Thailand after symptomatic P. vivax infections to monitor antibody kinetics over 9 months, during which no recurrent infections occurred. We assessed total IgG, IgG subclass and IgM levels to up to 52 P. vivax proteins every 2–4 weeks using a multiplexed Luminex® assay and identified protein-specific variation in antibody longevity. Mathematical modelling was used to generate the estimated half-life of antibodies, long-, and short-lived antibody-secreting cells. RESULTS Generally, an increase in antibody level was observed within 1-week post symptomatic infection, followed by an exponential decay of different rates. We observed mostly IgG1 dominance and IgG3 sub-dominance in this population. IgM responses followed similar kinetic patterns to IgG, with some proteins unexpectedly inducing long-lived IgM responses. We also monitored antibody responses against 27 IgG-immunogenic antigens in 30 asymptomatic individuals from a similar region. Our results demonstrate that most antigens induced robust and long-lived total IgG responses following asymptomatic infections in the absence of (detected) boosting infections. CONCLUSIONS Our work provides new insights into the development and maintenance of naturally acquired immunity to P. vivax and will guide the potential use of serology to indicate immune status and/or identify populations at risk. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION The online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1186/s12916-022-02281-9.","Malaria is an infectious disease caused by parasites under the genus of Plasmodium and is transmitted via female Anopheles mosquitoes. Plasmodium falciparum (P. falciparum) and Plasmodium vivax (P. vivax) are the two most common Plasmodium parasites that infect humans, causing significant morbidity and mortality worldwide. In particular, P. vivax is the most widely distributed Plasmodium species outside sub-Saharan Africa, contributing to more than 4.5 million cases in 2020. In southeast Asia, P. vivax accounts for 39% of the region’s malaria burden . The capacity of P. vivax to cause negative impacts on human health and, in some cases, death, is significant, especially for children under 5 years of age [2, 3]. P. vivax has several distinct features in its life cycle which make this species of Plasmodium a major challenge for elimination. The parasites are injected into the blood stream by a female Anopheles mosquito and quickly travel to the liver for maturation . An unknown proportion of the liver-stage parasites remain in the hepatocytes and enter dormancy for months up to years until they are reactivated (by currently unknown signals), re-initiating the blood-stage symptoms . These arrested liver-stage parasites are known as hypnozoites, and the delayed blood-stage infections they cause are manifesting relapses of the disease [6, 7]. Relapses can contribute up to 80% of all blood-stage infections [4, 5], but no current diagnostic tools can detect individuals who have hypnozoites in their livers but no current blood-stage parasites . Primaquine and tafenoquine are available to clear hypnozoites , but their use is contraindicated in individuals with G6PD deficiency [10–12]. Additionally, a high proportion of low-density asymptomatic P. vivax infections have been reported in multiple southeast Asian regions [13–15]. There is increasing evidence for other hidden reservoirs of P. vivax parasites, including in the spleen [16, 17] and bone marrow [18, 19], which may indeed contribute to the low-density peripheral blood-stage infections of P. vivax. These low-density asymptomatic individuals are often missed during screening and do not present to medical facilities, further contributing to ongoing transmission. New tools specifically targeting P. vivax are needed, particularly to identify hypnozoite carriers, or ideally, prevent hypnozoites from forming in the first place. An increased understanding of naturally acquired immune responses to the parasite could result in innovative approaches to both these challenges, including sero-surveillance  and the identification of novel vaccine candidates, along with the design of vaccines that induce long-lived immunity ."
PMC8914358,2022-01-17,regentrans: a framework and R package for using genomics to study regional pathogen transmission,"Increasing evidence of regional pathogen transmission networks highlights the importance of investigating the dissemination of multidrug-resistant organisms (MDROs) across a region to identify where transmission is occurring and how pathogens move across regions. We developed a framework for investigating MDRO regional transmission dynamics using whole-genome sequencing data and created regentrans, an easy-to-use, open source R package that implements these methods ( Using a dataset of over 400 carbapenem-resistant isolates of Klebsiella pneumoniae collected from patients in 21 long-term acute care hospitals over a one-year period, we demonstrate how to use our framework to gain insights into differences in inter- and intra-facility transmission across different facilities and over time. This framework and corresponding R package will allow investigators to better understand the origins and transmission patterns of MDROs, which is the first step in understanding how to stop transmission at the regional level.","The authors confirm all supporting data, code and protocols have been provided within the article or through supplementary data files. Multidrug-resistant organisms (MDROs) are a global public health threat due to limited treatment options paired with widespread global transmission . Healthcare facilities in particular, where critically ill patients reside in close proximity to one another, are hotspots of MDRO transmission . Furthermore, increasing evidence indicates that substantial transmission occurs not only within facilities, but also between facilities in regional healthcare networks, and that intra- and inter-facility transmission does not occur evenly across these networks [3, 4]. This observation, paired with limited resources for state and regional public health efforts, necessitates the identification of optimal intervention locations to reduce overall regional prevalence. Investigating MDRO transmission from a regional perspective can shed light on the origin and spread of MDROs, providing critical information for precision public health interventions to allocate resources to maximally reduce transmission across a region [5, 6]."
PMC8919175,2022-03-14,A systematic review of influenza A virus prevalence and transmission dynamics in backyard swine populations globally," Backyard swine farming is critical to generating subsistence and food security in rural and peri-urban households in several developing countries. The objective of this systematic review was to analyze the molecular and serological prevalence of influenza A virus (IAV) in backyard swine populations globally. RESULTS We identified 34 full-text research articles in NCBI-PubMed and Google Scholar databases that have reported IAV sero- and/or virological prevalence in backyard swine up to 11 July 2021. The highest number of studies were reported from Asia (n = 11) followed by North America (n = 10), South America (n = 6), Africa (n = 6), and Europe (n = 1). While the maximum number of studies (44.12%) reported human-to-swine transmission of IAV, swine-to-human (5.88%), poultry-to-swine (5.88%), and wild birds-to-swine (2.94%) transmissions were also reported. An overall higher IAV seroprevalence (18.28%) in backyard swine was detected compared to the virological prevalence (1.32%). The human-origin pandemic A(H1N1)pdm09 virus clade 1A.3.3.2 was the more frequently detected IAV subtype in virological studies (27.27%) than serological studies (18.92%). In addition, the avian-origin highly pathogenic H5N1 and H5N8 viruses were also detected, which further substantiated the evidence of avian–swine interactions in the backyards. CONCLUSION Human–swine and avian–swine interactions in backyards may transmit IAV between species. Monitoring the circulation and evolution of IAV in backyard swine would help stakeholders make informed decisions to ensure sustainable backyard swine farming and public safety.","Swine farming is the largest meat-producing industry, with gross production of more than one-third of all the meats consumed globally [1, 2]. While pork is produced mainly by large-scale commercial farms to meet the demand, many small-scale backyard farms co-exist, primarily for subsistence and food security, within the rural or peri-urban households in developing countries . A backyard farm is a household unit in rural, agrarian, or peri-urban communities that rears one or more animal species, including swine (Sus scrofa domesticus), chicken, ducks, turkey, and cattle, raised for either household consumption or supplying within the local community for subsistence. One prominent challenge backyard swine farming faces is the lack of suitable biosecurity, which may facilitate the dissemination of zoonotic pathogens, including influenza A virus (IAV), endangering backyard farming and public health. Negligence of biosecurity at the backyard farms may provide a suitable environment for disseminating IAV within the backyard animals, resulting in IAV disease outbreaks causing economic losses to the swine growers [3–10]. Several reports in the recent past have documented highly and low pathogenic avian influenza viruses in migratory and other birds [11–15] that can disseminate the IAV strains between the countries and continents . Interactions of wild birds with domestic poultry and swine may transmit the IAV in the backyards. Additionally, the probability of zoonotic and reverse zoonotic transmission of IAV between swine and occupationally exposed household members threatens public health. A schematic representation of IAV transmission in backyards is illustrated in Fig. 1. For the first time, we reported the serological and molecular prevalence and the transmission dynamics of IAV exclusively in backyard swine populations globally. This study describes the existing IAV circulation dynamics in backyard swine farms, which is essential to assess the current threat regarding the IAV disease outbreak. This study would also assist stakeholders in making an informed decision regarding minimizing the risk of IAV disease dissemination in backyard farms to ensure sustainable backyard swine farming."
PMC8943173,2022-03-23,Mitigating spread of contamination in meat supply chain management using deep learning,"Industry 4.0 recommends a paradigm shift from traditional manufacturing to automated industrial practices, especially in different parts of supply chain management. Besides, the Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 12 underscores the urgency of ensuring a sustainable supply chain with novel technologies including Artificial Intelligence to decrease food loss, which has the potential of mitigating food waste. These new technologies can increase productivity, especially in perishable products of the supply chain by reducing expenses, increasing the accuracy of operations, accelerating processes, and decreasing the carbon footprint of food. Artificial intelligence techniques such as deep learning can be utilized in various sections of meat supply chain management––where highly perishable products like spoiled meat need to be separated from wholesome ones to prevent cross-contamination with food-borne pathogens. Therefore, to automate this process and prevent meat spoilage and/or improve meat shelf life which is crucial to consumer meat preferences and sustainable consumption, a classification model was trained by the DCNN and PSO algorithms with 100% accuracy, which discerns wholesome meat from spoiled ones.","Supply chain management (SCM) remains one of the most critical factors in the development of various industries. Perishable product supply chain management has attracted scientific attention in the last two decades due to the rising demands for perishable products. It is estimated that 1.3 billion tons (i.e., economic value of over $1 trillion) of produced food is wasted annually, of which 25% of this wasted food can feed the 795 million malnourished people in the world1. Meat is a highly perishable product that accounts for 13% of food waste2. Besides, meat spoilage contributes to one-third of emissions (i.e., the greenhouse gas emissions like CO2) and 75% of land area used by wasted food3. Although traditional techniques which are prone to human errors, such as manually monitoring and controlling or utilizing non-intelligent systems, are still employed in meat supply chain management across countries, especially in developing economies4. However, the industry 4.0 paradigm recommends the automation of processes using novel technologies5 and new technologies such as artificial intelligence to enhance sustainable performance. Artificial intelligence can be employed to increase productivity while decreasing expenses and improving responsible production and consumption, as expounded in the Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 126,7.
 The SDG12 indicates efficient utilization of resources, developing energy productivity, sustainable infrastructure, green works, and guaranteeing a good life8. The SDG12 outlines multiple targets, including sustainable management and food waste reduction during production and supply chain9. Yet, the risk is unavoidable in perishable product supply chain management. The rising chemical and biological risk of contamination associated with highly perishable meat products increases meat spoilage, hence, affecting the sustainability of perishable products in the supply chain10. Meat has a short life, and its value decreases over time due to exposure to rot and damage during logistics, transport, and storage––which indicates the susceptibility, complexity, and uncertainty of meat and other perishable products in the supply chain11,12."
PMC8956170,2022-03-25,A quantitative microbial risk assessment for touchscreen user interfaces using an asymmetric transfer gradient transmission mode,"The ubiquitous use of public touchscreen user interfaces for commercial applications has created a credible risk for fomite-mediated disease transmission. This paper presents results from a stochastic simulation designed to assess this risk. The model incorporates a queueing network to simulate people flow and touchscreen interactions. It also describes an updated model for microbial transmission using an asymmetric gradient transfer assumption that incorporates literature reviewed empirical data concerning touch-transfer efficiency between fingers and surfaces. In addition to natural decay/die-off, pathogens are removed from the system by simulated cleaning / disinfection and personal-touching rates (e.g. face, dermal, hair and clothing). The dose response is implemented with an exponential moving average filter to model the temporal dynamics of exposure. Public touchscreens were shown to pose a considerable infection risk (∼3%) using plausible default simulation parameters. Sensitivity of key model parameters, including the rate of surface disinfection is examined and discussed. A distinctive and important advancement of this simulation was its ability to distinguish between infection risk from a primary contaminated source and that due to the re-deposition of pathogens onto secondary, initially uncontaminated touchscreens from sequential use. The simulator is easily configurable and readily adapted to more general fomite-mediated transmission modelling and may provide a valuable framework for future research.","Studies examining the typical microbiome of public TUIs have shown that it is made up of largely innocuous microbes found also on the human hand . However, harmful pathogens such as Enterococcus, E.coli and Staphylococcus aureus have also been found in concentrations typically ∼1 CFU/cm2 [6, 7] but as high as 60 CFU/cm2 . These concentrations may be taken as a baseline contamination level. Higher levels of contamination can occur when considering droplet deposition from someone suffering from a respiratory illness such as influenza. Viral concentrations in these droplets are on the order of ∼104

METHODS Between 1st January 2009 and 15th June 2019, we obtained the first WGS isolate from every patient resident in a postcode district covered by Birmingham's centralised tuberculosis service. Data on patients’ sex, country of birth, social risk-factors, anatomical locus of disease, and strain lineage were collected. Poisson harmonic regression was used to assess seasonal variation in case load and a mixed-effects multivariable Cox proportionate hazards model was used to assess risk factors for a future case arising in clusters defined by a 5 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) threshold, and by 12 SNPs in a sensitivity analysis. FINDINGS 511/1653 (31%) patients were genomically clustered with another. A seasonal variation in diagnoses was observed, peaking in spring, but only among clustered cases. Risk-factors for a future clustered case included UK-birth (aHR=2·03 (95%CI 1·35–3·04), p < 0·001), infectious (pulmonary/laryngeal/miliary) tuberculosis (aHR=3·08 (95%CI 1·98-4·78), p < 0·001), and M. tuberculosis lineage 3 (aHR=1·91 (95%CI 1·03–3·56), p = 0·041) and 4 (aHR=2·27 (95%CI 1·21–4·26), p = 0·011), vs. lineage 1. Similar results pertained to 12 SNP clusters, for which social risk-factors were also significant (aHR 1·72 (95%CI 1·02–2·93), p = 0·044). There was marked heterogeneity in transmission patterns between postcode districts. INTERPRETATION There is seasonal variation in the diagnosis of genomically clustered, but not non-clustered, cases. Risk factors for clustering include UK-birth, infectious forms of tuberculosis, and infection with lineage 3 or 4. FUNDING Wellcome Trust, MRC, UKHSA","Before the COVID-19 pandemic, England saw a steep decline in tuberculosis incidence over the preceding decade, with numbers falling from 8280 in 2011 to 4655 in 2018.1 This decline in incidence is seen in both UK and non-UK born populations.1,2 Some of this success has been attributed to structural changes to tuberculosis services, including a move to pre-entry screening for tuberculosis disease in new migrants from 2011; the implementation of the Collaborative TB Strategy 2015–20 and the establishment of TB control boards; and a focus on testing for tuberculosis infection in people aged 16–35 who arrived from a high-incidence country within 5 years.2, 3, 4 The precise impact of each intervention on the declining incidence remains unclear,2 and the task of eliminating tuberculosis is only likely to get harder as managing the residual case-load is inevitably more complex. As the competition for public health resources will remain fierce in the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic, there is an imperative to design and implement efficient and high-value interventions if the WHO's targets for ending the TB pandemic by 2035 are to be achieved in England, and indeed elsewhere.5"

We used a Bayesian evolutionary model, to infer phylogenetic trees and migration rates between two pathogen populations defined by their host-species. In order to account for sampling bias, sub-population structure was inferred using the marginal approximation of the structured coalescent (Mascot) implemented in BEAST2. We included 167 SB0821 strains (21 isolated from badgers and 146 from cattle) and identified 171 single nucleotide polymorphisms. We selected a HKY model and a strict molecular clock. We estimated a badger-to-cattle transition rate (median 2.2 transitions/lineage/year) 52 times superior to the cattle-to-badger rate (median 0.042 transitions/lineage/year). Using the maximum clade credibility tree, we identified that over 75% of the lineages from 1989 to 2000 were present in badgers. In addition, we calculated a median of 64 transition events from badger-to-cattle (IQR 10–91) and a median of zero transition event from cattle-to-badger (IQR 0–3). Our model enabled us to infer inter-species transitions but not intra-population transmission as in previous epidemiological studies, where relevant units were farms and badger social groups. Thus, while we could not confirm badgers as possible intermediaries in farm-to-farm transmission, badger-to-cattle transition rate was high and we confirmed long-term presence of M. bovis in the badger population in the South-West of France.

M. bovis host-species depend on the studied area and the role played by wildlife in these various multi-host systems can sometimes prove to be substantial. Indeed, different wildlife species have been implicated as reservoirs of M. bovis around the world; e.g. brush-tailed possums (Trichosurus vulpecula) in New Zealand  and white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) in Michigan, USA . In Europe, evidence supports badgers (Meles meles) in Ireland and Britain  and wild boars (Sus scrofa) in Spain  as bTB reservoirs. In France, wildlife M. bovis infection was first detected in red deer (Cervus elaphus) and wild boars in Normandy in 2001 . Since then, a national wildlife surveillance program, “Sylvatub” has reported infected badgers and boars in persistent clusters of infection such as the Pyrénées-Atlantiques, Landes and Dordogne “départements” (a French administrative subdivision) as well as infected red deer and roe deer (Capreolus capreolus) in Dordogne . In addition, M. bovis infection has recently been investigated in red foxes (Vulpes vulpes) and infection rates comparable to those in badgers and wild boars were found in Dordogne, Charente and Landes . In the European Union (EU), bTB has been until now subject to control programs (EU directive 64/432/EEC). In France, the program for eradication of bTB in cattle, which started in 1954 was quickly followed by a decrease of bTB herd incidence from 13% in 1965 to <0.1% in 2000 . Following a 6 year period with herd prevalence <0.1%, the officially free of bTB (OTF) status was obtained in 2001. The OTF status mainly presents an economic interest since it facilitates live cattle trade in the EU and with other countries (EU directive 64/432/EEC, ). However, this status is currently endangered by persistent clusters of infection, especially in the South-West of France . These past 2 years, the majority of infected herds (68/92 (74%) in 2019 and 84/104 (81%) in 2020) were detected in Nouvelle-Aquitaine (according to the Animal Health Epidemiological platform ESA), a “région”, which contains the Pyrénées-Atlantiques, Landes, Charente and Dordogne, amongst other “départements”."

Ethiopia decided to include Reactive Case Detection (RCD) and targeted Mass Drug Administration (tMDA) approaches as part of their elimination strategy along with rigorous evaluation. The purpose of this study is to compare the impact of RCD and tMDA on malaria elimination over the 2-year study period, by looking at the annual parasite incidence before and after the intervention. METHODS The study will be conducted in the East Hararghe zone of Ethiopia. Malaria transmission in the area is low to moderate. This study will deploy a community-based, three-arm, cluster-randomized control trial implemented over 2 years. Forty-eight clusters (16 clusters per arm) will be selected based on the annual number of confirmed malaria cases seen in the cluster. All clusters will receive the current standard of care in terms of malaria elimination interventions provided by the national malaria control program. In addition, following the identification of malaria parasite infection, individuals who reside within a 100-m radius of the index case will receive a diagnosis for malaria and treatment if positive in the RCD arm or presumptive treatment in the tMDA arm. The primary effectiveness endpoint will be measured at baseline and endline for each intervention arm and compared to the control arm using a difference in difference approach.

PMC9042872,2022-04-26,Characterizing tuberculosis transmission dynamics in high-burden urban and rural settings,"Mycobacterium tuberculosis transmission dynamics in high-burden settings are poorly understood. Growing evidence suggests transmission may be characterized by extensive individual heterogeneity in secondary cases (i.e., superspreading), yet the degree and influence of such heterogeneity is largely unknown and unmeasured in high burden-settings. We conducted a prospective, population-based molecular epidemiology study of TB transmission in both an urban and rural setting of Botswana, one of the highest TB burden countries in the world. We used these empirical data to fit two mathematical models (urban and rural) that jointly quantified both the effective reproductive number, [Formula see text] , and the propensity for superspreading in each population. We found both urban and rural populations were characterized by a high degree of individual heterogeneity, however such heterogeneity disproportionately impacted the rural population 99% of secondary transmission was attributed to only 19% of infectious cases in the rural population compared to 60% in the urban population and the median number of incident cases until the first outbreak of 30 cases was only 32 for the rural model compared to 791 in the urban model. These findings suggest individual heterogeneity plays a critical role shaping local TB epidemiology within subpopulations.","Tuberculosis (TB), an airborne infectious disease caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis, is a major global epidemic with an estimated 10 million new cases and 1.5 million deaths annually1. TB incidence varies widely from country to country, ranging from less than 10 cases per 100,000 people in almost all high-income countries, to over 500 per 100,000 people in several low- and middle-income countries1. These remarkable disparities suggest substantial reductions in incidence are achievable if policymakers are able to identify population-specific factors that determine TB transmission and implement targeted preventive measures2–5. Understanding TB transmission dynamics is a notorious challenge given the marked variation in timing between infection and clinical TB disease. Limited evidence suggests TB transmission may be characterized by a high degree of individual heterogeneity, or differences in the number of secondary cases caused by each infectious individual6–10. Such heterogeneity implies outbreaks are rarer but more extensive, and has profound implications in infectious disease control11–14. However, such research has overwhelmingly focused on individual outbreaks in low-burden settings, and the degree and population-level influence of individual heterogeneity in high-burden TB populations remains unknown14,15. Researchers have explicitly called for an improved understanding of individual heterogeneity in high-burden populations3,6,14–17."
PMC9044371,2022-04-22,"BMDD: a novel approach for IoT platform (broker-less and microservice architecture, decentralized identity, and dynamic transmission messages)","Undeniably, Internet of Things (IoT) devices are gradually getting better over time; and IoT-based systems play a significant role in our lives. The pervasiveness of the new essential service models is expanding, and includes self-driving cars, smart homes, smart cities, as well as promoting the development of some traditional fields such as agriculture, healthcare, and transportation; the development of IoT devices has not shown any sign of cooling down. On the one hand, several studies are coming up with many scenarios for IoT platforms, but some critical issues related to performance, speed, power consumption, availability, security, and scalability are not yet fully resolved. On the other hand, IoT devices are manufactured and developed by different organizations and individuals; hence, there is no unified standard (uniformity of IoT devices), i.e., sending and receiving messages among them and between them and the upper layer (e.g., edge devices). To address these issues, this paper proposes an IoT Platform called BMDD (Broker-less and Microservice architecture, Decentralized identity, and Dynamic transmission messages) that has a combination of two architectural models, including broker-less and microservices, with cutting-edge technologies such as decentralized identity and dynamic message transmission. The main contributions of this article are five-fold, including (i) proposing broker-less and microservice for the IoT platform which can reduce single failure point of brokering architecture, easy to scale out and improve failover; (ii) providing a decentralized authentication mechanism which is suitable for IoT devices attribute (i.e., mobility, distributed); (iii) applying the Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) model for the authorization process; (iv) exploiting the gRPC protocol combined with the Kafka message queue enhances transmission rates, transmission reliability, and reduces power consumption in comparison with MQTT protocol; and (v) developing a dynamic message transmission mechanism that helps users communicate with any device, regardless of the manufacturer, since it provides very high homogeneity.","In recent times, science and technology have developed significantly, which leads to stricter and more demanding needs from users. The current scientific landscape can be generally described as connecting the cutting-edge techniques as well as meeting the era’s demands. As the Fourth Industrial Revolution spread throughout the globe, all devices/sensors were able to connect to the wireless system (e.g., Bluetooth, Wifi, Zigbee) to increase the intra-interoperability among themselves and the different layers (e.g., devices – owners). In particular, the communication among the devices connect via a 5G/6G mobile network, the Internet for long-range transmission or wifi version 6.0, and Bluetooth version 5.0 for short-range connection. The need for increasing transmission speed has promoted research in the field of signal processing and wireless transmission. To cover that, all devices have internet capability, a.k.a Internet of Things (IoT). The released IoTs architecture platforms/models allows the user’s device connect to the Internet; thereby they are able to monitor and configure access control, enabling collecting and exchanging their data. This development is the main reasons for the birth of Big Data-related fields. The Big Data data analysis challenge is not only a discrete and meaningless combination but helps providers perceive users’ behavior or habits to predict customers. As data becomes a new oil, new requirements for IoT platforms are set to ensure the privacy of users’ data (Ateş, Bostanci & Güzel, 2020). After obtaining data that has undergone analysis by Big Data, Machine Learning, and AI applications, devices can “learn” from the data itself and the owner’s feedback in specific cases; at this point, the concept of “smart devices” is introduced. IoT platforms also replace humans operating in dangerous places such as high mountains, deep oceans, or even outer space (Pillai et al., 2019). For Big Data or AI applications to operate effectively, a massive amount of data is sufficiently required to be rapidly and accurately collected, and the IoT platform is the main component responsible for this problem (Ulah et al., 2020)."
PMC9044385,2022-04-27,A telemedicine-based approach with real-time transmission of blood glucose data improves metabolic control in insulin-treated diabetes: the DIAMONDS randomized clinical trial,"PURPOSE To evaluate if a web-based telemedicine system (the Glucoonline(®) system) is effective to improve glucose control in insulin-treated patients with type 1 and type 2 diabetes, as compared to standard of care. METHODS This was a prospective, randomized, controlled trial, carried out at three tertiary referral centers for diabetes in Italy. Adults with insulin-treated type 1 and type 2 diabetes, inadequate glycemic control, and no severe diabetes-related complications and/or comorbidities were eligible for this study. Patients were randomized to either perform telemedicine-assisted (Group A) or standard (Group B) self-monitoring blood glucose (SMBG) for 6 months. In Group A, patients received prompt feedback about their blood glucose levels and therapy suggestions from the study staff via phone/SMS, when appropriate. In Group B, patients had no remote assistance from the study staff between planned visits. RESULTS 123 patients were included in the final analysis. After 6 months, patients achieved a significant reduction in HbA1c in Group A (−0.38%, p < 0.05) but not in Group B (+ 0.08%, p = 0.53). A significant difference in the percentage of patients with HbA1c < 7% between Group A and Group B was found after 3 months (28.6% vs 11.1%, p = 0.02). Also, fewer patients (p < 0.05) with HbA1c > 8.5% were found in Group A vs Group B, respectively, after both 3 months (14.3% vs 35.2%) and 6 months (21.8% vs 42.9%). CONCLUSIONS The use of the Glucoonline™ system resulted in improved metabolic control. Telemedicine services have potential to support diabetes self-management and provide the patients with remote, prompt assistance using affordable technological equipment. Trial registration This study was registered at clinicaltrials.gov (NCT01804803) on March 5, 2013.","Self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG) is a cornerstone of diabetes management, as it may help detect the effects of glucose-lowering therapies and patient lifestyle on individual blood glucose (BG) levels [1–3]. International guidelines recommend individualized SMBG frequency based on multiple factors, including type of diabetes, treatment regimen (i.e., lifestyle intervention, non-insulin oral and injectable agents, or insulin), quality of glycemic control, risk of hypoglycemia, and patient's willingness to self-test [4, 5]. Accordingly, most patients using intensive insulin therapy (multiple daily injections or insulin pump therapy) are required to check their BG at least 3–4 times daily . However, to fully exploit SMBG and achieve glucose targets, SMBG should be performed in a structured manner (e.g., before meals and snacks, at bedtime, occasionally postprandially, before exercise, when hypoglycemia is suspected, before driving, etc.), and the results need to be accurately interpreted and used to guide adjustments in medications, especially insulin, and to modify food intake and/or physical activity [7, 8]. Nevertheless, a substantial proportion of patients who report checking their BG at least once daily also report taking no action when results show high or low values ."
PMC9069814,2022-05-05,The role of gilts in transmission dynamics of swine influenza virus and impacts of vaccination strategies and quarantine management," Along with an expanding global swine production, the commercial housing and management of swine herds, provide an optimal environment for constant circulation of swine influenza virus (swIAV), thereby challenging farmers and veterinarian in determining optimal control measures. The aim of this study was to investigate the role of gilts in the swIAV transmission dynamics, and to evaluate the impact of different control measures such as quarantine and gilt vaccination. METHODS The study was conducted as a cross-sectional study in ten Danish sow herds, including five swIAV vaccinated and five unvaccinated herds. Blood- and nasal swab samples of gilts, first parity sows and their piglets were collected at different stages in the production system (quarantine in/out, mating, gestation and farrowing) and analyzed for the presence of swIAV and swIAV antibodies. Associations between the detection of swIAV, seroprevalence, antibody levels, sow and gilt vaccination strategy and quarantine biosecurity were thereafter investigated to identify possible risk factors for swIAV introductions and persistence within the herds. RESULTS Nine of the ten herds of the study had swIAV circulation and swIAV was detected in the quarantine, mating- and farrowing unit. The prevalence of seropositive gilts and first parity sows was significantly higher in the vaccinated herds, but swIAV was still present in nasal swabs from both gilts, first parity sows and piglets in these herds. Quarantine gilt vaccination and all-in/all-out management resulted in a significant reduction of swIAV positive gilts at the end of the quarantine period. CONCLUSION The results underline that herd vaccination and/or quarantine facilities are crucial to avoid swIAV introductions into sow herds. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION The online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1186/s40813-022-00261-2.","During the last 10 years, several studies have described the herd-level persistence of swIAV as a consequence of the expanding swine production favoring large-scale production systems [1–7]. These production systems, if not applying very strict biosecurity measures to avoid mixing of age groups etc., provides a constant weekly flow of naïve individuals ensuring continuous swIAV circulation [1–3, 8]. Only few studies have investigated the role of gilts and first parity sows in the within-herd persistence of swIAV [7, 9–12]. However, gilts potentially play a major role for novel swIAV introductions as the majority of the sows-herds only introduce animals from an outside source in relation to replacement of the breeding stock [7, 13]. Moreover, if the gilts are not immunized properly before entering the sow herd, they may be naïve to the circulating swIAV herd strain, thereby contributing to the continued enzootic swIAV circulation . Two previous studies have shown correlations between introduction of gilts and an increase risk of herd-level persistence of swIAV [9, 10]. To the author’s knowledge, however, none of the previous studies sampled gilts and first parity sows at different stages of the production system/ages, and further associated the detection of swIAV and swIAV antibodies with the herd vaccination strategy and quarantine measures. The aim of this study was therefore to investigate the role of the gilts in the swIAV transmission dynamics, by assessing the prevalence of swIAV and swIAV antibodies of gilts and first parity sows in the period from arrival to the quarantine unit and until 1-week after farrowing. A secondary aim was to evaluate associations between swIAV vaccination, quarantine managements and biosecurity measures in the herds on the prevalence of swIAV and swIAV antibodies."
PMC9119444,2022-05-09,A nonstructural protein encoded by a rice reovirus induces an incomplete autophagy to promote viral spread in insect vectors,"Viruses can hijack autophagosomes as the nonlytic release vehicles in cultured host cells. However, how autophagosome-mediated viral spread occurs in infected host tissues or organs in vivo remains poorly understood. Here, we report that an important rice reovirus, rice gall dwarf virus (RGDV) hijacks autophagosomes to traverse multiple insect membrane barriers in the midgut and salivary gland of leafhopper vector to enhance viral spread. Such virus-containing double-membraned autophagosomes are prevented from degradation, resulting in increased viral propagation. Mechanistically, viral nonstructural protein Pns11 induces autophagy and embeds itself in the autophagosome membranes. The autophagy-related protein 5 (ATG5)-ATG12 conjugation is essential for initial autophagosome membrane biogenesis. RGDV Pns11 specifically interacts with ATG5, both in vitro and in vivo. Silencing of ATG5 or Pns11 expression suppresses ATG8 lipidation, autophagosome formation, and efficient viral propagation. Thus, Pns11 could directly recruit ATG5-ATG12 conjugation to induce the formation of autophagosomes, facilitating viral spread within the insect bodies. Furthermore, Pns11 potentially blocks autophagosome degradation by directly targeting and mediating the reduced expression of N-glycosylated Lamp1 on lysosomal membranes. Taken together, these results highlight how RGDV remodels autophagosomes to benefit viral propagation in its insect vector.","Autophagy is a multistep, conserved process by which cytoplasmic components, such as damaged organelles and foreign pathogens, become enveloped into double-membraned autophagosomes and are shuttled to lysosomes for degradation in eukaryotic cells . This process begins with the formation of membrane crescents, called phagophores, which then extend to form enclosed double-membraned autophagosomes . Autophagy-related proteins (ATGs) and two ubiquitin-like conjugation systems mediate phagophore elongation and the subsequent generation of double-membraned autophagosomes. The first conjugation system entails ATG8-I, which is constitutively processed by ATG4 to expose conserved glycine residues to produce the phospholipid ATG8-II, and is conjugated to the membrane lipid phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) at the autophagosome membranes [2,3]. ATG8-PE is involved in the elongation and closure of the autophagosome membranes . The second conjugation system contributes to the coupling of ATG12 with ATG5 for forming a covalently linked heterodimer on the phagophore membranes [3,4]. This conjugate is mobilized to the phagophore to produce E3-like activity toward the ATG8-PE complex . Finally, the autophagosomes are fused with lysosomes to form autolysosomes, where the cytoplasmic materials or invading pathogens are degraded . Lysosome-associated membrane protein (Lamp) consists of a polypeptide core of ~40 kDa and is decorated by a significant number (16–20) of N-glycans . Lamp protects lysosomal membranes from lysosomal hydrolases that normally digest membrane components . It is generally believed that host cells use the autophagy as a defense against invading viruses [7,8]. For example, autophagy has been proved to play a direct antiviral role against the arbovirus vesicular stomatitis virus in the model organism Drosophila . Viruses have also evolved strategies to subvert autophagy by targeting autophagy machinery. For example, Herpes simplex virus type 1 neurovirulence protein prevents the phagophore formation by binding to Beclin 1, a key factor involved in the elongation of the phagophore membranes . Human herpes virus-8 can suppress autophagy by preventing ATG3 from binding and processing ATG8 during autophagosome elongation . Barley stripe mosaic virus (BSMV) γb protein subverts autophagy to promote viral infection by disrupting the interaction of ATG7 with ATG8 . More importantly, viruses have also evolved strategies to inhibit the fusion of autophagosomes with lysosomes, thus directly exploiting autophagosomes as viral replication sites or as the nonlytic release vehicles in host cells [3,13,14]. Currently, most of such studies are limited to cultured host cells in vitro; how autophagosome-mediated viral spread occurs in infected host tissues or organs in vivo remains poorly understood."
PMC9126089,2022-05-10,The effects of geographical distributions of buildings and roads on the spatiotemporal spread of canine rabies: An individual-based modeling study,"Rabies is a fatal disease that has been a serious health concern, especially in developing countries. Although rabies is preventable by vaccination, the spread still occurs sporadically in many countries, including Thailand. Geographical structures, habitats, and behaviors of host populations are essential factors that may result in an enormous impact on the mechanism of propagation and persistence of the disease. To investigate the role of geographical structures on the transmission dynamics of canine rabies, we developed a stochastic individual-based model that integrates the exact configuration of buildings and roads. In our model, the spatial distribution of dogs was estimated based on the distribution of buildings, with roads considered to facilitate dog movement. Two contrasting areas with high- and low-risk of rabies transmission in Thailand, namely, Hatyai and Tepha districts, were chosen as study sites. Our modeling results indicated that the distinct geographical structures of buildings and roads in Hatyai and Tepha could contribute to the difference in the rabies transmission dynamics in these two areas. The high density of buildings and roads in Hatyai could facilitate more rabies transmission. We also investigated the impacts of rabies intervention, including reducing the dog population, restricting owned dog movement, and dog vaccination on the spread of canine rabies in these two areas. We found that reducing the dog population alone might not be sufficient for preventing rabies transmission in the high-risk area. Owned dog confinement could reduce more the likelihood of rabies transmission. Finally, a higher vaccination coverage may be required for controlling rabies transmission in the high-risk area compared to the low-risk area.","Rabies is a fatal zoonotic disease caused by a Lyssavirus belonging to the family Rhabdovirudae . This virus is responsible for around 59,000 human deaths annually worldwide . Dogs have been identified as the main reservoirs for the rabies virus in many developing countries, mostly located in Asia and Africa, including Thailand . In 2015, there was a call for global efforts to set a goal for zero human dog-mediated rabies deaths by 2030 worldwide . To achieve this, the prevention and control policies for rabies issued by affected countries must be driven by scientific evidence and implemented effectively. The factors that greatly contribute to the spread of the virus must be revealed, and the policies should be revised accordingly. As dogs serve as the main source of human rabies, preventing and controlling canine rabies will inevitably prevent human rabies. High-coverage dog vaccination has been widely recommended to eliminate canine rabies. The World Health Organization (WHO) suggested that an effective vaccination program should reach at least 70% of the population . In various contexts, however, different vaccination coverages, as well as vaccination strategies, may be required. Dog sterilization is an approach for controlling the reproduction of the dog population, specifically to stabilize or reduce the population size. In India, for example, using this method in conjunction with dog vaccination proved beneficial in controlling rabies . Alternatively, dog culling has been practiced, even though this approach was unsuccessful in several areas [6–8] In China, dog vaccination programs alone might be insufficient to control rabies; however, dog culling in combination with vaccination has been recommended to enhance the rabies control ."
PMC7088082,2005-10-31,Emerging and Reemerging Infectious Diseases: Biocomplexity as an Interdisciplinary Paradigm,"Understanding factors responsible for reemergence of diseases believed to have been controlled and outbreaks of previously unknown infectious diseases is one of the most difficult scientific problems facing society today. Significant knowledge gaps exist for even the most studied emerging infectious diseases. Coupled with failures in the response to the resurgence of infectious diseases, this lack of information is embedded in a simplistic view of pathogens and disconnected from a social and ecological context, and assumes a linear response of pathogens to environmental change. In fact, the natural reservoirs and transmission rates of most emerging infectious diseases primarily are affected by environmental factors, such as seasonality or meteorological events, typically producing nonlinear responses that are inherently unpredictable. A more realistic view of emerging infectious diseases requires a holistic perspective that incorporates social as well as physical, chemical, and biological dimensions of our planet’s systems. The notion of biocomplexity captures this depth and richness, and most importantly, the interactions of human and natural systems. This article provides a brief review and a synthesis of interdisciplinary approaches and insights employing the biocomplexity paradigm and offers a social–ecological approach for addressing and garnering an improved understanding of emerging infectious diseases. Drawing on findings from studies of cholera and other examples of emerging waterborne, zoonotic, and vectorborne diseases, a “blueprint” for the proposed interdisciplinary research framework is offered which integrates biological processes from the molecular level to that of communities and regional systems, incorporating public health infrastructure and climate aspects.","Understanding the mechanisms that underlie newly emerging and reemerging infectious diseases (EID) is one of the most difficult scientific problems facing society today. EIDs are diseases that have recently increased in incidence or in geographic or host range (e.g., tuberculosis, cholera, malaria, dengue fever, Japanese encephalitis, West Nile fever, and yellow fever), diseases caused by new variants assigned to known pathogens (e.g., HIV, new strains of influenza virus, SARS, drug resistant strains of bacteria, Nipah virus, Ebola virus, hantavirus pulmonary syndrome, and avian influenza virus), and bacteria newly resistant to antibiotics, notably the multiple resistant strains that render the armamentarium of antibiotics useless (Smolinski et al., 2003). Fundamental questions persist concerning molecular mechanisms and specific cellular processes involved in pathogenesis, as well as transmission dynamics and epidemiology, of pathogens that cause some of the most studied of the reemerging infectious diseases, such as tuberculosis, malaria, and cholera. Newly emerging diseases caused by entirely novel or previously unrecognized pathogens, such as HIV/AIDS, SARS, and hantavirus, or those whose modes of transmission are currently under study, as in the case of Ebola and Nipah, represent yet another significant challenge. Certainly the mechanisms or processes of disease emergence involve factors in addition to those at molecular and cellular levels. These include climate, rainfall, ocean and air circulation patterns, and extreme weather events, as well as the ecology of the pathogens’ reservoirs and vectors, namely those factors associated with larger-scale mechanisms and the dynamic behavior of ecosystems in which parasite (pathogen) and host relationships are embedded (Horwitz and Wilcox, 2005). Still other factors are involved, and must be identified, if a truly holistic framework is to be constructed that incorporates factors related to human and societal mechanisms."

PMC7123051,2016-07-28,A Model for Coupled Outbreaks Contained by Behavior Change,"Large epidemics such as the recent Ebola crisis in West Africa occur when local efforts to contain outbreaks fail to overcome the probabilistic onward transmission to new locations. As a result, there may be large differences in total epidemic size from similar initial conditions. This work seeks to determine the extent to which the effects of behavior changes and metapopulation coupling on epidemic size can be characterized. While mathematical models have been developed to study local containment by social distancing, intervention and other behavior changes, their connection to larger-scale transmission is relatively underdeveloped. We make use of the assumption that behavior changes limit local transmission before susceptible depletion to develop a time-varying birth-death process capturing the dynamic decrease of the transmission rate associated with behavior changes. We derive an expression for the mean outbreak size of this model and show that the distribution of outbreak sizes is approximately geometric. This allows a probabilistic extension whereby infected individuals may initiate new outbreaks. From this model we characterize the overall epidemic size as a function of the behavior change rate and the probability that an infected individual starts a new outbreak. We find good agreement between the analytical results and stochastic simulations leading to novel findings including critical learning rates that demarcate large and small epidemic sizes.","Many questions arise during outbreaks of emerging infectious diseases. How transmissible is the new pathogen within the initially exposed population? How fast will it spread to other populations? What must be done to achieve containment? How large will the final epidemic be? These questions and others are amenable to theoretical analysis using dynamic models . Most models of disease transmission, however, assume time constant parameters and do not account for changing human behavior or other interventions. The 2014–2015 West Africa Ebola epidemic illustrates this point. With an \documentclass[12pt]{minimal}

Because standard models admit containment only after the outbreak becomes self-limiting through depletion of susceptible persons, they are inappropriate for making predictions about apparent infections, where self-protective behaviors may be quickly adopted, and in modern societies, where global financial, medical, and logistic resources are rapidly mobilized to contain emerging pathogens like SARS, MERS, and Ebola. But, if behaviors change and resources are quickly mobilized, then why have outbreaks of these emerging pathogens persisted as long as they have? One possible explanation is that behavior change and intervention are local events that occur only around transmission clusters and are not completely efficient, so that while behavior change and intervention act to reduce transmission where it is high, a small fraction of infections escape isolation to seed new outbreaks in spatially or socially adjacent populations. According to this idea, the persistence of the pathogen in the population—and the propensity to transition from outbreak to epidemic proportions—is based on a balance between the ability of the pathogen to spark new outbreaks and the capacity of behavior change and intervention to contain these outbreaks before further spread occurs.

PMC7123311,2018-10-25,Searching for Superspreaders: Identifying Epidemic Patterns Associated with Superspreading Events in Stochastic Models,"The importance of host transmissibility in disease emergence has been demonstrated in historical and recent pandemics that involve infectious individuals, known as superspreaders, who are capable of transmitting the infection to a large number of susceptible individuals. To investigate the impact of superspreaders on epidemic dynamics, we formulate deterministic and stochastic models that incorporate differences in superspreaders versus nonsuperspreaders. In particular, continuous-time Markov chain models are used to investigate epidemic features associated with the presence of superspreaders in a population. We parameterize the models for two case studies, Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) and Ebola. Through mathematical analysis and numerical simulations, we find that the probability of outbreaks increases and time to outbreaks decreases as the prevalence of superspreaders increases in the population. In particular, as disease outbreaks occur more rapidly and more frequently when initiated by superspreaders, our results emphasize the need for expeditious public health interventions.","The prevalence of most infectious diseases is often assumed to emerge from person-to-person interactions among a population of individuals who are considered homogeneous with respect to contact, transmission, and recovery behavior. However, it is more realistic to assume that diseases spread among a heterogeneous population. Host heterogeneity may be due to physiological, behavioral, or immunological differences . Behavioral differences may also be related to the environmental setting . For example, some individuals are at a higher risk for spreading the disease due to increased contact with susceptible persons or longer length of infection. This has been observed in the spread of sexually transmitted and vector-borne diseases, where high-risk individuals are characterized by the “20/80” rule, in which 20% of the infected individuals are responsible for 80% of the disease transmission [21, 41]. The 2002–2003 SARS epidemic highlighted the role of superspreaders (SS), defined as people who infect a large number of individuals, in comparison to nonsuperspreaders (NS) who transmit the disease to few or none [6, 15, 30, 40]. However, the exact characteristics of SS and their impact on disease dynamics are difficult to define. Lloyd et al. studied the effects of heterogeneity in infectiousness and then found that the proportion of SS contributed to high levels of heterogeneity for several infectious diseases (e.g., SARS, measles, influenza, rubella, smallpox, Ebola, and other diseases) . Currently, there are no well-known methods for identifying SS in the population or control efforts to reduce the disease transmission at the individual or population levels based on SS. We consider two infectious diseases, Ebola and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), that are associated with certain cultural and health behaviors for which contact patterns may be traceable. Focusing on these two epidemic cases, we will provide insight into disease patterns associated with superspreading events. Ebola virus was first discovered in 1976 in Africa, in the country now named the Democratic Republic of the Congo, near the Ebola river. Ebola virus can persist in the environment through animal-to-animal transmission, e.g., bats can transmit the virus to apes, monkeys, antelopes, and other animals. The virus can also be transmitted to humans through contact with infected animals in the environment during hunting, meat preparation, or from an animal bite. Infection can be transmitted to other humans through contact with bodily fluids, such as blood, secretions, and organs of sick or diseased individuals, or with contaminated objects, such as bedding and clothes. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), the 2014–2016 Ebola outbreak in West Africa had the most cases and deaths of any Ebola outbreak to date . This spread might have been increased due to infected health-care workers’ close contact with susceptible individuals. Additionally, burial ceremonies may increase contact with infectious deceased bodies that contain the virus. The incubation period, defined as the time of infection to onset of symptoms, ranges from 2 to 21 days . Individuals can recover from Ebola; however, mortality rates range from 25 to 90%. In 2016, the WHO announced that the first vaccine trial implemented in Guinea was 100% effective [17, 37]. The recent preventive measures announced by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) include reducing contacts with infected animals or bodily fluids of infected individuals, isolating infected and deceased individuals, early detection of infected individuals, and maintaining a clean environment ."

A general SIRS model is presented that tracks the place of residence of individuals, allowing for different movement rates of local residents and visitors in a city. Provided the basic reproduction number is greater than one, we demonstrate in our model that increasing the travel volumes of some infected groups may result in the extinction of a disease, even though the disease cannot be eliminated in each city when the cities are isolated.","The spatial spread of infectious diseases has been observed many times in history. Most recent examples include the 2002–2003 SARS epidemic in Asia and the global spread of the 2009 pandemic influenza A(H1N1). The Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) outbreak emerged in 2012, and West Africa is currently witnessing the extensive Ebola virus (EBOV) outbreak, that pose a global threat. There is an increasing interest in the mathematical modelling literature for the spread of epidemics between discrete geographical locations (patches, or cities). Such metapopulation models incorporate single or multiple species occupying multiple spatial patches that are connected by movement dependent or independent of disease status. Such models have been discussed for an array of infectious diseases including measles and influenza, by Arino and coauthors [2–5], Sattenspiel and coauthors [14, 15], Wang and coauthors [9, 13, 19, 20]. The work of Arino , and Arino and van den Driessche  provide a thorough review of the literature.

PMC7123814,2019-10-08,Dynamical Behavior of an SVIR Epidemiological Model with Two Stage Characteristics of Vaccine Effectiveness and Numerical Simulation,"An SVIR epidemiological model with two stage characteristics of vaccine effectiveness is formulated. By constructing the appropriate Lyapunov functionals, it is proved that the disease free equilibrium of the system is globally stable when the basic reproduction number is less than or equal to one, and that the unique endemic equilibrium of the system is globally stable when the basic reproduction number is greater than one.","In human history, infectious diseases have repeatedly brought great disaster to human survival. In recent years, the outbreak of some new infectious diseases (SARS, influenza A (H1N1), influenza A (H7N9), etc.) has caused a great impact on people’s lives. Vaccines are biological agents made from bacteria, viruses, tumor cells and so on, which enable antibodies to produce specific immunity. Vaccination can provide immunity to those who are vaccinated, can eliminate the spread of some diseases (such as smallpox) . In recent years, more and more authors study the epidemiological models with vaccination [2–5]. Some authors assume that vaccine recipients will not be infected [2, 3]; some other authors assume that vaccine recipients may still be infected [4, 5], but the probability of being infected is smaller than before vaccination. In fact, for some infectious diseases, the vaccinated individuals would not be infected for some time after vaccination. However, bacteria or viruses mutate as time goes by, and the efficacy of the vaccine is correspondingly affected, which makes it is possible for the vaccinated individuals to be infected. For example, the new H7N9 influenza virus mutates more quickly, and the effectiveness of the vaccine depends largely on the extent of the virus mutation . Based on the above facts, we assume that vaccine effectiveness has two stage characteristics in the first stage, the vaccinated individuals will not be infected; in the second stage, the vaccinated individuals will be infected, but the probability of infection will be smaller than before vaccination. Therefore, this paper studies the epidemiological model with two stage characteristics of vaccine effectiveness, On the basis of getting the basic reproductive number, by using appropriate functionals, the stability of the model is proved by the algebraic approach provided by the reference ."
PMC7123968,2018-04-28,The Ecology of Pathogen Spillover and Disease Emergence at the Human-Wildlife-Environment Interface,"Novel diseases are increasingly emerging into human populations through the complex—and often, unseen—stepwise process of spillover from a combination of wildlife, livestock, vectors, and the abiotic environment. Characterizing and modeling the spillover interface are a key part of how eco-epidemiologists respond to the growing global burden of emerging infectious diseases; but the diversity of pathogen life cycles and transmission modes poses a complex challenge for ecologists and clinicians alike. We review our current understanding of the spillover process and present a framework that relates spillover rates and human-to-human transmissibility to the basic reproduction number (R ). Using pathogens that exemplify important transmission pathways (anthrax, Ebola, influenza, and Zika), we illustrate key aspects of the spillover interface and discuss implications to public health and management of emerging infectious disease.","The spread of environmental or animal pathogens into human populations is a natural and perpetual process that dates back as far as human records extend. One of the earliest recorded epidemics, the plague of Athens (also called the Thucydides syndrome), took place between 430 and 425 B.C.E. and is believed to have been an outbreak of Ebola virus (Olson et al. 1996) or typhoid fever (Papagrigorakis et al. 2006). Measles emerged in human populations after evolving from rinderpest, a disease of cattle, sometime around the eleventh or twelfth century, and perhaps the most famous disease outbreak in recorded history, the Black Death, was caused by plague (Yersinia pestis), a vector-borne zoonosis. In this sense, the emergence of diseases is a natural process, the by-product of pathogen “chatter” between susceptible host populations of different species, with the emergence of diseases into human populations only a small subset of the broader cross talk among mammals, and animals writ large. This process of spillover is stochastic and, from the perspective of pathogen success, fairly imperfect. The majority of mammalian viruses lack the capacity to even infect humans, and the majority of spillover events that do occur fail to establish circulating infection in the new host. But despite the long and complex history of peoples and plagues, scientific consensus indicates that the rate of infectious disease emergence has been accelerating in more recent history. Differentiating the next pandemic from background noise is a nearly insurmountable challenge and one that is ongoing as new pathogens evolve or are discovered. As participants in clinically relevant research settings, the task of ecologists studying spillover revolves around three key issuesDescribing the process of spillover and interactions and state changes between hosts, pathogens, and the environment that lead to disease emergenceDeveloping predictive conceptual and quantitative models that can explain spillover patterns and forecast disease emergence, epidemic behavior, and/or intervention impactApplying ecological and clinical knowledge to develop interventions that mitigate, control, and potentially prevent epidemics and pandemics

PMC7136996,2020-04-07,"Epidemiological characteristics and transmissibility of shigellosis in Hubei Province, China, 2005 – 2017"," Shigellosis is one of the main diarrhea diseases in developing countries. However, the transmissibility of shigellosis remains unclear. METHODS We used the dataset of shigellosis cases reported between January 2005 and December 2017, from Hubei Province, China. A mathematical model was developed based on the natural history and the transmission mechanism of the disease. By fitting the data using the model, transmission relative rate from person to person (b) and from reservoir to person (b(w)), and the effective reproduction number (R(eff)) were estimated. To simulate the contribution of b and b(w) during the transmission, we performed a “knock-out” simulation in four scenarios A) b = 0 and b(w) = 0; B) b = 0; C) b(w) = 0; D) control (no intervention). RESULTS A total of 130,770 shigellosis cases were reported in Hubei province, among which 13 cases were dead. The median annual incidence was 19.96 per 100,000 persons (range 5.99 per 100,000 persons – 29.47 per 100,000 persons) with a decreased trend (trend χ = 25,470.27, P < 0.001). The mean values of b and b(w) were 0.0898 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.0851–0.0946) and 1.1264 × 10(− 9) (95% CI 4.1123 × 10(− 10)–1.8416 × 10(− 9)), respectively. The “knock-out” simulation showed that the number of cases simulated by scenario A was almost the same as scenario B, and scenario C was almost the same as scenario D. The mean value of R(eff) of shigellosis was 1.19 (95% CI 1.13–1.25) and decreased slightly with a Linear model until it decreased to an epidemic threshold of 0.99 (95% CI 0.65–1.34) in 2029. CONCLUSIONS The incidence of shigellosis is still in high level. The transmissibility of the disease is low in Hubei Province. The transmission would be interrupted in the year of 2029.","Shigellosis, caused by Shigella spp which are Gram-negative bacteria, is a fecal-oral transmission disease with a symptom of severe colitis and induced by a very low infectious dose [1, 2]. In developing countries, Shigella spp are one of the top four attributable causes of moderate–severe diarrhea in children younger than 5 years. Shigellosis is an illness that kills roughly 750,000 people per year [3–5]. Although the incidence of shigellosis has declined remarkably due to the rapid improvements in water supply and sanitation in China , a considerable disease burden still exists and is unevenly distributed across the country [7–9]. Because of the different transmission conditions resulted from social-economic factors such as water supply and hygiene practices in different areas, the transmission of shigellosis is heterogeneous and is still a major public health problem in many areas in China [7, 10, 11]. The transmission interruption has a public importance in China as well as many developing countries. Generally, whether an infectious disease spreads or not depends on the size of transmissibility or “transmission force” behind the transmission. However, to our knowledge, there is no study investigating the transmissibility of shigellosis. Therefore, an understanding the transmissibility of shigellosis is of great significance to ensure a better disease prevention and control. The transmissibility of an infectious disease is commonly quantified by basic reproduction number (R0), which is defined as the expected number of secondary infections that result from introducing a single infected individual into an otherwise susceptible population [12–15]. However, because of the disease intervention or the decreasing proportion of susceptible individuals due to the spread of the pathogen, it is hard to estimate R0. Therefore, effective reproduction number (Reff) is commonly employed instead, with the definition of the number of new cases which was produced by a typical case during the period of infection [16, 17]. From the definition, it is clear that when Reff > 1, the disease is able to spread in the population. If Reff < 1, the infection will be cleared from the population. Therefore, Reff = 1 is considered as the “epidemic threshold”."
PMC7140974,2020-02-26,Visualising the expansion and spread of coronavirus disease 2019 by cartograms,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has emerged as a growing focus of global attention and a critical factor in public-health decision making. Towards fighting the COVID-19 outbreak, countries worldwide and international organisations have taken various actions, including promoting the transparency of and public access to disease data. In such public communications, maps have played an important role in that a map is worth a thousand words. Most of these have taken the form of a choropleth map. Here, we propose employing cartograms to visualise both the expansion and spread of COVID-19. We designed a combination of six circular cartograms containing the data of confirmed cases every 48 hours from 24 January to 3 February 2020. Such a design conveys both spatial and temporal information more intuitively and efficiently, so it can be expected to facilitate better public participation in the fight against COVID-19.","Fighting the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak has very recently emerged as a critical challenge for China and the focus of global attention. Named by the World Health Organization (WHO, 2020), COVID-19 (whose earlier temporary name was 2019-nCoV) is a novel coronavirus identified with close genetic relatedness to severe acute respiratory syndrome and is highly contagious. By 7 February 2020, more than 30,000 confirmed cases of COVID-19 had been reported for globally, according to the Situation Report of the WHO. Most of these confirmed cases are from China, especially the Hubei province. In the fight against COVID-19, one important strategy is to keep the public informed on progress via the media, including maps and graphics. Here, we propose visualising the expansion and spread of COVID-19 using area cartograms. The study area is 31 Chinese provinces (or equivalent administrative units), excluding Hong Kong, Macaw and Taiwan. These 31 provinces were selected because of the same data source, namely provincial health commissions. In employing an area cartogram, we identified three major types contiguous, non-contiguous and circular (also called the Dorling cartogram; Dorling, 1996; Gao et al., 2019). We tested all three types, finding that the most appropriate in our case is the circular cartogram. To make it easier to distinguish between different circles, we coloured circular cartograms using a scientific scheme designed by Harrower and Brewer , with two constraints (a) adjacent circles do not share the same colour, and (b) the colour of each province remains stable among different cartograms."
PMC7165700,2019-12-19,Distinct spread of DNA and RNA viruses among mammals amid prominent role of domestic species,"AIM Emerging infectious diseases arising from pathogen spillover from mammals to humans constitute a substantial health threat. Tracing virus origin and predicting the most likely host species for future spillover events are major objectives in One Health disciplines. We assessed patterns of virus sharing among a large diversity of mammals, including humans and domestic species. LOCATION Global. TIME PERIOD Current. MAJOR TAXA STUDIED Mammals and associated viruses. METHODS We used network centrality analysis and trait‐based Bayesian hierarchical models to explore patterns of virus sharing among mammals. We analysed a global database that compiled the associations between 1,785 virus species and 725 mammalian host species as sourced from automatic screening of meta‐data accompanying published nucleotide sequences between 1950 and 2019. RESULTS We show that based on current evidence, domesticated mammals hold the most central positions in networks of known mammal–virus associations. Among entire host–virus networks, Carnivora and Chiroptera hold central positions for mainly sharing RNA viruses, whereas ungulates hold central positions for sharing both RNA and DNA viruses with other host species. We revealed strong evidence that DNA viruses were phylogenetically more host specific than RNA viruses. RNA viruses exhibited low functional host specificity despite an overall tendency to infect phylogenetically related species, signifying high potential to shift across hosts with different ecological niches. The frequencies of sharing viruses among hosts and the proportion of zoonotic viruses in hosts were larger for RNA than for DNA viruses. MAIN CONCLUSIONS Acknowledging the role of domestic species in addition to host and virus traits in patterns of virus sharing is necessary to improve our understanding of virus spread and spillover in times of global change. Understanding multi‐host virus‐sharing pathways adds focus to curtail disease spread.","Pathogen spillover and cross‐species transmission between animals and humans is a major source of infectious diseases and a considerable global public health burden (Jones et al., 2008; Karesh et al., 2012). Understanding the factors that enable or facilitate these processes is a crucial step for such events to be predicted. Host shifting, that is the colonization of a new host species by a pathogen, requires a certain level of overlap in species traits (“ecological fitting”) in order to overcome barriers of cross‐species transmission and for survival and reproduction within novel host species (Agosta, Janz, & Brooks, 2010; Parrish et al., 2008; Woolhouse, Haydon, & Antia, 2005). In the search for mechanisms and enabling conditions that might help to predict the future emergence of infectious diseases from animal populations, the necessity of considering entire host species communities amongst underpinning biogeographical structure and connectivity has recently been emphasized (Clark et al., 2018; Fenton, Streicker, Petchey, & Pedersen, 2015; Poulin, 2010; Wells et al., 2018). Network analyses that describe the connections of different host species in terms of parasite sharing have proved useful in analysing host specificity and parasite spread (Gómez, Nunn, & Verdú, 2013; Luis et al., 2015), particularly given that they offer the opportunity to explore community‐wide pathogen spread (the distribution of a pathogen among host species, a pattern emerging from past and contemporary host‐shifting events that connect host species as nodes in a network). Other recent “big data” studies of mammal–virus associations have explored whether host traits and geographical distribution can predict those species that are most likely to harbour undiscovered viruses that might cause future pandemics using trait‐based regression analysis (Han, Schmidt, Bowden, & Drake, 2015; Luis et al., 2015; Olival et al., 2017). Such approaches might lead to increased predictability of future pandemics."
PMC7217544,2018-11-27,Relevance of backtracking paths in recurrent-state epidemic spreading on networks,"The understanding of epidemics on networks has greatly benefited from the recent application of message-passing approaches, which allow us to derive exact results for irreversible spreading (i.e., diseases with permanent acquired immunity) in locally treelike topologies. This success has suggested the application of the same approach to recurrent-state epidemics, for which an individual can contract the epidemic and recover repeatedly. The underlying assumption is that backtracking paths (i.e., an individual is reinfected by a neighbor he or she previously infected) do not play a relevant role. In this paper we show that this is not the case for recurrent-state epidemics since the neglect of backtracking paths leads to a formula for the epidemic threshold that is qualitatively incorrect in the large size limit. Moreover, we define a modified recurrent-state dynamics which explicitly forbids direct backtracking events and show that this modification completely upsets the phenomenology.","The study of epidemic processes  has been one of the fundamental levers in the development of modern network science . Research in this field has been based on the consideration of several simplified epidemic models , the most fundamental being the susceptible-infected-susceptible (SIS) and the susceptible-infected-removed (SIR) models. In both of them, a susceptible (healthy) individual, in contact through an edge with an infected individual, contracts the disease at rate β. In the SIS model infected nodes become spontaneously susceptible again at rate μ, while in the SIR model infected individuals become removed and cannot contract the disease again. This variation results in a different collective behavior SIS allows for a long-lived (infinitely long in the thermodynamic limit of infinite network size) steady state with a finite fraction of infected individuals, while the SIR model proceeds by epidemic outbreaks of finite duration that reach a given fraction of individuals in the population. Both these models are characterized by the presence of an epidemic threshold λc for the control parameter, defined as the ratio between the infection and the healing rates, λ=β/μ. In the SIS model, the region λ≤λc corresponds to the healthy phase, in which epidemic episodes die out exponentially fast; for λ>λc, on the other hand, a steady state with a finite fraction of infected individuals is observed. For the SIR model, on the other hand, the healthy phase corresponds to outbreaks affecting an infinitesimally small fraction of the population, while for λ>λc the final fraction of removed individuals becomes finite. Initial analytical understanding of epidemic processes on networks was based on the so-called heterogeneous mean-field (HMF) approach , which assumes that the network is annealed  and topologically uncorrelated . Under these assumptions, both the SIR and the SIS processes exhibit a threshold λcHMF inversely proportional to the second moment q2 of the degree distribution P(q) characterizing the topology of the network . For a distribution scaling as a power law for a large degree, P(q)∼q−γ, as empirically observed in many contexts , this second moment scales, for γ≤3, as q2∼qmax3−γ, where qmax is the maximum degree in the network . In this regime γ≤3, the maximum degree diverges in the limit of infinite network size, leading to a vanishingly small epidemic threshold. For γ>3, instead, both the second moment and the threshold attain a finite value in the thermodynamic limit."
PMC7217545,2018-12-18,Epidemic spreading and aging in temporal networks with memory,"Time-varying network topologies can deeply influence dynamical processes mediated by them. Memory effects in the pattern of interactions among individuals are also known to affect how diffusive and spreading phenomena take place. In this paper we analyze the combined effect of these two ingredients on epidemic dynamics on networks. We study the susceptible-infected-susceptible (SIS) and the susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR) models on the recently introduced activity-driven networks with memory. By means of an activity-based mean-field approach, we derive, in the long-time limit, analytical predictions for the epidemic threshold as a function of the parameters describing the distribution of activities and the strength of the memory effects. Our results show that memory reduces the threshold, which is the same for SIS and SIR dynamics, therefore favoring epidemic spreading. The theoretical approach perfectly agrees with numerical simulations in the long-time asymptotic regime. Strong aging effects are present in the preasymptotic regime and the epidemic threshold is deeply affected by the starting time of the epidemics. We discuss in detail the origin of the model-dependent preasymptotic corrections, whose understanding could potentially allow for epidemic control on correlated temporal networks.","In many social and information systems, the timescales for the evolution of the interaction network are often comparable to the timescales of the dynamical processes taking place on top of them . The diffusion of online information or the spreading of transmitted diseases in a population are typical examples of such processes, for which a focus on a static representation of the network is not able to capture the very influence of the rapidly varying topology [2–7]. In addition, recent advances in technology have allowed one to measure and monitor the evolution of interactions with an unprecedented time resolution , calling for new theories to understand the effect of time-varying topologies on dynamical processes. Interactions and the creation of links are generated by the agents' activity, a quantity that can be easily measured from available large-scale and time-resolved data sets . An interesting line of modeling has developed, aiming at including explicitly the effect of activity distributions on network dynamics activity-driven networks . In activity-driven models, each agent is endowed with a degree of freedom that encodes the propensity of the individual to engage in a social event, establishing a link with another agent in the system. Notably, measured activities are typically highly heterogeneous and this has strong effects on network evolution."
PMC7217547,2018-12-28,Epidemic spreading with awareness diffusion on activity-driven networks,"Acknowledging the significance of awareness diffusion and behavioral response in contagion outbreaks has been regarded as an indispensable prerequisite for a complete understanding of epidemic spreading. Recent studies from the research community have accumulated overwhelming evidence for the incessantly evolving structure of the underlying networks. Thus there is an impelling need to capture the interplay between the epidemic spreading and awareness diffusion on time-varying networks. In this paper, we consider a behavioral model in which susceptible individuals become alert and adopt a preventive behavior under the local risk perception characterized by a decision-making threshold. The impact of awareness diffusion on the epidemic threshold is investigated under the framework of activity-driven network. Results show that the local epidemic situation in risk perception and the duration of preventive effect are crucial for raising the epidemic threshold. The analytical results are corroborated by Monte Carlo simulations.","The modeling and analysis of epidemic spreading lie at the core of our understanding about the unfolding of dynamical processes in complex networks, such as malware spreading and information dissemination. In spite of the major advances in this area, one common assumption has been employed that considers a time separation between the evolution in network structures and the contagion process, which limits the spreading process to be typically considered on static networks or annealed networks [1–3]. As the latest empirical studies showed that the contagion of many infectious diseases and the evolution of network structure have a comparable time scale [4,5], the theoretical analysis of these contagion processes requires the development of a novel analytical framework. Correspondingly, an activity-driven approach has been recently put forward for an explicit representation of time-varying connectivity patterns . Under the framework of activity-driven networks (ADNs), the epidemic models incorporating other network characteristics have been proposed by adapting the generative rules of ADNs, such as the community structure [7–9] and the metapopulation model , the lifetimes of links  and weak/strong ties [12,13], the node's attractiveness [14,15] and the mutual selection . The above works are concerned about the influence of network structure on the epidemic spreading process. Furthermore, nodes in the network can only be passively infected. However, in the real world, individuals are in the position to be aware of the potential threat of disease and they would behave accordingly. Remarkably, risk perception of infectious disease has been acknowledged as an indispensable ingredient for accurate modeling of epidemic spreading process on static networks . In this context, the awareness is reflected in the contact behavior that would change the connection patterns [18,19], or the preventive measures that would modify the propagation parameters [20,21]. Inspired by them, there is an impelling need to include the individual's behavior for depicting contagion processes on the ADNs. Among the limited works in this direction, authors in Ref.  investigated the effect of human behavioral adaptations by assuming that the activity level of individuals would be reduced based on their own states and global awareness effect. Such an activity reduction is also considered in Ref. , with the risk perception embodied in a function of the global prevalence or the growth rate of infection. In addition to the reduction of activity level in contact behavior, the preventive behaviors that would decrease the risk of infection without disrupting the connection patterns is considered in a recent study ."
PMC7217552,2020-01-14,Impact of the distribution of recovery rates on disease spreading in complex networks,"We study a general epidemic model with arbitrary recovery rate distributions. This simple deviation from the standard setup is sufficient to prove that heterogeneity in the dynamical parameters can be as important as the more studied structural heterogeneity. Our analytical solution is able to predict the shift in the critical properties induced by heterogeneous recovery rates. We find that the critical value of infectivity tends to be smaller than the one predicted by quenched mean-field approaches in the homogeneous case and that it can be linked to the variance of the recovery rates. Our findings also illustrate the role of dynamical-structural correlations, where we allow a power-law network to dynamically behave as a homogeneous structure by an appropriate tuning of its recovery rates. Overall, our results demonstrate that heterogeneity in the recovery rates, eventually in all dynamical parameters, is as important as the structural heterogeneity.","Heterogeneity, whether in the nature of the components or the pattern of connections, is a key characteristic of complex systems. This is particularly evident in the case of the spreading of a disease in a networked population, where the inclusion of structural heterogeneity has long been known to radically change the process's critical behavior [1–6]. As an illustration, consider two classical contagion models, the susceptible-infected-susceptible (SIS) and the susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR) models. On a homogeneous network, they both present a nonvanishing critical point [5,6]. However, the introduction of structural heterogeneity, in the form of broad degree distributions of the nodes, can result in a vanishing critical point [1,5–7]. More specifically, in the thermodynamic limit, a divergence of the second moment of the degree distribution [1,5,6,8] or a divergence in the maximum degree [1,5,6,8] implies a vanishing critical infectivity. This in turn has important practical implications for real-world networks, because many of them display very broad [7–9] (or even scale-free) degree distributions . References [11–18] considered, in contrast, homogeneous structures but accounted for arbitrary times in the state transitions. Interestingly, previous works studied models characterized by a series of infected states (without a biological interpretation) that described the global behavior accurately [12–15,17]. Notably, the model proposed in  is general, but each transition has an assigned function, which complicates the model, making its practical use limited. These works encounter, however, a fundamental limitation, because they describe the population at the mean-field level [11–18]. While structural and dynamical heterogeneities are independently accounted for, modeling both types of heterogeneities together has received considerably less attention until recently. Indeed, it was mainly studied for the SIR model A message-passing formalism was proposed in [19,20] and a heterogeneous mean-field approach in . In the latter, the authors also performed numerical experiments showing that the population can be more vulnerable in the scenario with dynamical heterogeneity. More recently, this problem was investigated on temporal networks  using an SIS process, which was described within the quenched mean-field (QMF) formalism and mainly focusing on spreading rates [23,24]. A similar approach was considered in , where however the authors highlighted a different aspect, i.e., the allocation of resources during an outbreak. Here we investigate a different type of dynamical heterogeneity by characterizing the critical properties of an SIS model when recovery rates are distributed heterogeneously across the population. Heterogeneous recovery rate distributions can be associated with biological differences between individuals [26,27], demographic characteristics , and social differences that result in nonhomogeneous access to the health system . Additionally, we also consider the case in which correlations arise between the structure and dynamics. We show, both analytically and numerically, that such correlations can induce opposing and unexpected dynamical outcomes, for example, power-law (PL) networks displaying nonvanishing critical points and conversely homogeneous networks displaying vanishing critical points. Indeed, we show that the standard QMF predictions, which are a lower bound in the standard scenario, no longer provide such a bound in the heterogeneous rate case. We then propose a simple formulation to overcome this and provide a different lower bound for the process. Our results complement previous evidence on the SIR model  and imply that proper characterization of the dynamical parameters is of utmost importance not only for a better understanding of spreading processes, but also for many practical applications, such as surveillance, forecasting, resource management, and network reconstruction, among many others."
PMC7217557,2018-11-28,Close and ordinary social contacts: How important are they in promoting large-scale contagion?,"An outstanding problem of interdisciplinary interest is to understand quantitatively the role of social contacts in contagion dynamics. In general, there are two types of contacts close ones among friends, colleagues and family members, etc., and ordinary contacts from encounters with strangers. Typically, social reinforcement occurs for close contacts. Taking into account both types of contacts, we develop a contact-based model for social contagion. We find that, associated with the spreading dynamics, for random networks there is coexistence of continuous and discontinuous phase transitions, but for heterogeneous networks the transition is continuous. We also find that ordinary contacts play a crucial role in promoting large-scale spreading, and the number of close contacts determines not only the nature of the phase transitions but also the value of the outbreak threshold in random networks. For heterogeneous networks from the real world, the abundance of close contacts affects the epidemic threshold, while its role in facilitating the spreading depends on the adoption threshold assigned to it. We uncover two striking phenomena. First, a strong interplay between ordinary and close contacts is necessary for generating prevalent spreading. In fact, only when there are propagation paths of reasonable length which involve both close and ordinary contacts are large-scale outbreaks of social contagions possible. Second, abundant close contacts in heterogeneous networks promote both outbreak and spreading of the contagion through the transmission channels among the hubs, when both values of the threshold and transmission rate among ordinary contacts are small. We develop a theoretical framework to obtain an analytic understanding of the main findings on random networks, with support from extensive numerical computations. Overall, ordinary contacts facilitate spreading over the entire network, while close contacts determine the way by which outbreaks occur, i.e., through a second- or first-order phase transition. These results provide quantitative insights into how certain social behaviors can emerge and become prevalent, which has potential implications not only to social science but also to economics and political science.","The spreading of certain behaviors (contagion) in the human society has social, economical, and political implications, which has attracted a great deal of interdisciplinary research effort. Conventional methods developed to uncover and understand the dynamics of social contagion are more or less based on some kind of threshold and memory effects [1–10]. For example, it is likely for an individual to adopt certain behavior if he/she possesses friends who have already adopted the behavior. From a network point of view, for a node to adopt certain behavior, the number of connected nodes who have already accepted and exhibit the behavior must exceed a threshold [1,11]. That is, an individual will become willing to adopt a behavior if he/she has received sufficient and repeated information about the behavior from his/her friends (or neighbors in the underlying social network) [12,13]. In the real world, the influences of network neighbors and the tendency for any individual to adopt certain behavior can be highly nonuniform. There is empirical evidence that individuals and their social contacts tend to play heterogeneous roles in contagion [14,15]. For example, regardless of the nature of the behavior, there always exist certain individuals who are reluctant to accept or adopt the behavior. To account for the heterogeneity, a variant of the classic threshold model  was introduced , where a certain fraction of nodes were assumed to be immune to the behavior. These are the blocked nodes, and if their number or density is large enough, both the extent and diffusion speed of the contagion spreading will be suppressed, provided that no cascading or avalanche type of processes occur. The effects of heterogeneity in social contacts have been recently studied  using a contagion threshold model incorporating weighted edges, with the finding that heterogeneity in the weights can suppress the propagation of contagion. The influences from connected neighbors in a social network represent a kind of reinforcement effect, where the probability of adopting certain social behavior by an individual is modified when he/she receives information about the behavior through social contacts. In recent years, spreading dynamics driven by reinforcement have attracted a great deal of attention from researchers in diverse fields including social science, economics, and physics [9,12,17–20]. The key fact that motivated our present work is that, with respect to reinforcement, the nature of social contacts can have drastically different impacts. In particular, from close social contacts such as family members, friends, and colleagues, reinforcement can be much stronger than that from conventional or ordinary social contacts with, e.g., strangers. For a model of social contagion to capture the real behaviors as accurately as possible, the distinct reinforcement effects from close and ordinary social contacts must be taken into account."
PMC7219435,2018-12-03,Epidemic spreading on time-varying multiplex networks,"Social interactions are stratified in multiple contexts and are subject to complex temporal dynamics. The systematic study of these two features of social systems has started only very recently, mainly thanks to the development of multiplex and time-varying networks. However, these two advancements have progressed almost in parallel with very little overlap. Thus, the interplay between multiplexity and the temporal nature of connectivity patterns is poorly understood. Here, we aim to tackle this limitation by introducing a time-varying model of multiplex networks. We are interested in characterizing how these two properties affect contagion processes. To this end, we study susceptible-infected-susceptible epidemic models unfolding at comparable timescale with respect to the evolution of the multiplex network. We study both analytically and numerically the epidemic threshold as a function of the multiplexity and the features of each layer. We found that higher values of multiplexity significantly reduce the epidemic threshold especially when the temporal activation patterns of nodes present on multiple layers are positively correlated. Furthermore, when the average connectivity across layers is very different, the contagion dynamics is driven by the features of the more densely connected layer. Here, the epidemic threshold is equivalent to that of a single layered graph and the impact of the disease, in the layer driving the contagion, is independent of the multiplexity. However, this is not the case in the other layers where the spreading dynamics is sharply influenced by it. The results presented provide another step towards the characterization of the properties of real networks and their effects on contagion phenomena.","Social interactions take place in different contexts and modes of communication. On a daily basis we interact at work, in the family, and across a wide range of online platforms or tools, e.g., Facebook, Twitter, emails, mobile phones, etc. In the language of modern network science, social networks can be conveniently modeled and described as multilayer networks [1–5]. This is not a new idea. Indeed, the intuition that social interactions are stratified in different layers dates back several decades [6–8]. However, the digitalization of our communications and the miniaturization of devices has just recently provided the data necessary to observe, at scale, and characterize the multilayer nature of social interactions. As in the study of single layered networks, the research on multilayer graphs is divided in two interconnected areas. The first deals with the characterization of the structural properties of such entities [1,4]. One of the central observations is that the complex topology describing each type of interaction (i.e., each layer) might be different. Indeed, the set and intensity of interactions in different contexts (e.g., work, family, etc.) or platforms (e.g., Facebook, Twitter, etc.) is not the same. Nevertheless, layers are coupled by individuals active across two or more of them. The presence of such coupling as well as its degree is often referred to as multiplexity. Another interesting feature of multilayer graphs is that the connectivity patterns in different layers might be topologically and temporally correlated [9–11]. The second area of research instead considers the function, such as sustaining diffusion or contagion processes, of multilayer networks [1,12,13]. A large fraction of this research aims at characterizing how the complex structural properties of multilayer graphs affect dynamical processes unfolding on their fabric. The first important observation is that disentangling connections in different layers gives rise to complex and highly nontrivial dynamics function of the interplay between interlayer and intralayer connections [14–26]. A complete summary of the main results in the literature is beyond the scope of the paper. We refer the interested reader to these recent resources for details [1–5]."
PMC7268584,2020-06-03,What is the research evidence for antibiotic resistance exposure and transmission to humans from the environment? A systematic map protocol," Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a public health crisis that is predicted to cause 10 million deaths per year by 2050. The environment has been implicated as a reservoir of AMR and is suggested to play a role in the dissemination of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs). Currently, most research has focused on measuring concentrations of antibiotics and characterising the abundance and diversity of ARGs and antibiotic resistant bacteria (ARB) in the environment. To date, there has been limited empirical research on whether humans are exposed to this, and whether exposure can lead to measureable impacts on human health. Therefore, the objective of this work is to produce two linked systematic maps to investigate previous research on exposure and transmission of AMR to humans from the environment. The first map will investigate the available research relating to exposure and transmission of ARB/ARGs from the environment to humans on a global scale and the second will investigate the prevalence of ARB/ARGs in various environments in the UK. These two maps will be useful for policy makers and research funders to identify where there are significant gluts and gaps in the current research, and where more primary and synthesis research needs to be undertaken. METHODS Separate search strategies will be developed for the two maps. Searches will be run in 13 databases, and grey literature will be sought from key websites and engagement with experts. Hits will be managed in EndNote and screened in two stages (title/abstract then full text) against predefined inclusion criteria. A minimum of 10% will be double screened with ongoing consistency checking. All included studies will have data extracted into a bespoke form designed and piloted for each map. Data to be extracted will include bibliographic details, study design, location, exposure source, exposure route, health outcome (Map 1); and prevalence/percentage of ARB/ARG (Map 2). No validity appraisal will be undertaken. Results will be tabulated and presented narratively, together with graphics showing the types and areas of research that has been undertaken and heatmaps for key exposure-health outcomes (Map 1) and exposure-prevalence (Map 2).","Antibiotics are antimicrobials used to prevent and treat bacterial infections. Their efficacy is important as their use is critical in human and veterinary medicine, as well as in food production practices . Presently, the efficacy of antibiotics is being undermined by the ability of bacteria to resist the actions of these drugs (antibiotic resistance). This results in treatment failure, prolonged morbidity and increased risk of mortality when treating infections caused by resistant pathogens . The devastating impact of such resistance has led to antibiotic resistance and antimicrobial resistance (AMR) more broadly, being placed on the UK Risk Register, alongside other critical risks such as climate change, pandemic influenza and global terrorism [3, 4]. It has been predicted that by 2050 AMR will be the leading cause of death globally, accounting for 10 million deaths per year . The term AMR includes resistance to agents with antimicrobial properties by microorganisms, such as bacterial, fungal, viral or parasitic organisms. It is frequently used interchangeably in the literature with the term antibiotic resistance. However, the focus of this study will be antibiotic resistant bacteria (ARB). The occurrence of infections that are resistant to antimicrobials is increasing globally [1, 5, 6]. Successful treatment of resistant bacterial infections increasingly relies on more expensive “last-resort” antibiotics. Resistance has, however, already developed to such antibiotics, for example, colistin . In addition, there are few novel antimicrobials being discovered and coming to market, as the investment (in time and money) needed to develop these drugs is high and as small returns is promised in the lifetime of the patent . In the last three decades, only two antibiotic classes, oxazolidinones and cyclic lipopeptides, have been brought to market . Without the discovery of new antibiotics, and with the development of resistance, it is possible that we will enter an era similar to that before the discovery of antibiotics, where routine medical procedures become far riskier as a result of our inability to prevent or treat infections which are currently simple to treat ."
PMC7281693,2020-06-09,"The influence of vaccination on the control of JE with a standard incidence rate of mosquitoes, pigs and humans","In this article, a nonlinear mathematical model used for the impact of vaccination on the control of infectious disease, Japanese encephalitis with a standard incidence rate of mosquitoes, pigs and humans has been planned and analyzed. During the modeling process, it is expected that the disease spreads only due to get in touch with the susceptible and infected class only. It is also assumed that due to the effect of vaccination, the total human population forms a separate class and avoids contact with the infection. The dynamical behaviors of the system have been explored by using the stability theory of differential equations and numerical simulations. The local and global stability of the system for both equilibrium states under certain conditions has been studied. We have set up a threshold condition in the language of the vaccine-induced reproduction number [Formula see text] , which is fewer than unity, the disease dies in the absence of the infected population, otherwise, the infection remains in the population. Furthermore, it is found that vaccine coverage has a substantial effect on the basic reproduction number. Also, by continuous efforts and effectiveness of vaccine coverage, the disease can be eradicated. It is also found a more sensitive parameter for the transmission of Japanese encephalitis virus by using sensitivity analysis. In addition, numerical results are used to investigate the effect of some parameters happening the control of JE infection, for justification of analytical results.","Japanese encephalitis (JE) is an illness of the brain caused through the Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) and is transmitted from the pig population to the human population through bloodsucking insects Culex mosquitoes, Centers for Disease Control, (CDC). The JEV is maintained in a natural enzootic cycle between reservoir population (especially pigs), mosquitoes and humans. The transmission of JEV, for the most part, happens in the country in horticultural zones, where floodwater system and rice development are related [1–4]. In the areas where JEV is endemic the annual incident range from 1 to 10 cases per 10,000 person per year affected children are under 16 years of age . The time duration of infection to illness in infected humans is about 5–15 days and initial symptoms are fever, headache and vomiting [3, 6–8]. Most humans who are infected with only a few symptoms or have no symptoms and JE can be more deadly in advanced stages, National Vector Borne Disease Control Program, (NVBDCP). The first human case of JEV was registered in Japan in 1935 and in India in 1955 [3, 9]. Unfortunately, there is no specific treatment available that can cure Japanese encephalitis, including the management of some basic supportive medical care and complications in medicine. Those who experience a more severe form of the disease will have to undergo treatment at the hospital. The finding of JE disease ought to be performed by utilizing a JEV-explicit immunoglobulin M (IgM) counteracting agent catch ELISA for serum and cerebrospinal liquid (CSF). JEV-explicit IgM can be estimated in the CSF of most patients by four days after the commencement of side effects and in serum by seven days after inception. The prevention of JE is mainly based on the control of mosquitoes and the vaccination of the human population. To control the mosquito population, some methods like using insecticides, reducing the number of breeding sites on your property, by killing the mosquito larvae where the insect’s breed and bed nets are used in endemic regions. Mathematical modeling of infectious disease has a long history for understanding the effects of vaccination. Through the speedy rate of vaccine development, medical science has saved millions of lives. Smallpox, influenza, polio and lots of supplementary diseases are conquering examples in this regard . In the present life, it is bizarre and uncommon for a youngster not to get an antibody. An individual can get accessible immunizations for a malady common in his general vicinity. Some sickness immunizations are as of now created and anybody can take the antibody if the specific malady is in danger for it. Currently, several groups of vaccines available in the world like inactivated Vero cell culture-derived JE vaccine, SA 14-14-2 live attenuated JE vaccine, Ixiaro JE vaccine, etc. But Ixiaro is the only licensed JE vaccine available in the United States . It was avowed in march 2009 for the use of the human population aged more than 17 years. Later on, May 2013, avowed for the use of children whose aged lies between 2 months to 16 years [1, 6, 12]. The essential inoculation plans for Ixiaro is two portions intramuscularly administrated on 0–28 days. For youngsters from 2 months to 2 years, each dose is 0.25 ml, for grownups and kids for more than 3 years, each dose is 0.5 ml. Prior, In India, the mouse brain-derived JE antibody was utilized, yet the productivity was insufficient to meet the national prerequisite [13, 14]. The SA 14-14-2 live attenuated JE vaccine has been utilized in China for over 20 years with an effectiveness of 80% for single-dose and 97.5% for a two-doses routine with 1 year interim among youngsters under 15 years old [11, 14]. Thus, the effectiveness of the JE vaccine is more than 90%, but the time duration of protection with the JE vaccine is not clear, but its effectiveness appears to decrease over time [1, 6]."
PMC7308089,2020-06-22,A divergent cyclin/cyclin-dependent kinase complex controls the atypical replication of a malaria parasite during gametogony and transmission,"Cell cycle transitions are generally triggered by variation in the activity of cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) bound to cyclins. Malaria-causing parasites have a life cycle with unique cell-division cycles, and a repertoire of divergent CDKs and cyclins of poorly understood function and interdependency. We show that Plasmodium berghei CDK-related kinase 5 (CRK5), is a critical regulator of atypical mitosis in the gametogony and is required for mosquito transmission. It phosphorylates canonical CDK motifs of components in the pre-replicative complex and is essential for DNA replication. During a replicative cycle, CRK5 stably interacts with a single Plasmodium-specific cyclin (SOC2), although we obtained no evidence of SOC2 cycling by transcription, translation or degradation. Our results provide evidence that during Plasmodium male gametogony, this divergent cyclin/CDK pair fills the functional space of other eukaryotic cell-cycle kinases controlling DNA replication.","Progression through the cell cycle critically relies upon post-translational mechanisms including changes in activity of cell cycle kinases and phosphatases, and ubiquitin-mediated degradation of specific components once their function is complete. Central components of these networks are the cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs). Many different families of CDK exist (Lim and Kaldis, 2013). In most model organisms however, those primarily regulating DNA replication and mitosis belong to a monophyletic family that includes human CDK1-CDK4/6, Cdc2 and Cdc28 in fission and budding yeasts, respectively, and CDKA in plants (Guo and Stiller, 2004; Cao et al., 2014). In malaria parasites, seven CDKs have been described (Talevich et al., 2012; Tewari et al., 2010; Solyakov et al., 2011). Of these, five are divergent CDK-related kinases (CRK), i.e. they are clearly related to CDKs but have no clear orthologues in the yeast or human kinomes. These include CRK5 (PBANKA_1230200), which forms a distinct branch within the CDK cluster with atypical sequence motifs in the activation loop and an additional 148 amino acid C-terminal extension found only in Plasmodium (Dorin-Semblat et al., 2013). The gene is required, but not essential, for proliferation of asexual blood stages of the human parasite P. falciparum (Dorin-Semblat et al., 2013). The primary regulator of CDK activity is the cyclin subunit. Cyclins were originally named because of their oscillation in level that reach a threshold required to drive cell-cycle transitions (Morgan, 1995; Malumbres and Barbacid, 2009). Cyclins are now defined as a family of evolutionarily related proteins encoding a cyclin box motif that is required for binding to the CDK catalytic subunit (Cao et al., 2014). Plasmodium genomes contain no sequence-identifiable G1-, S-, or M-phase cyclins, and only three proteins have sequence homology with cyclin family members in other eukaryotes (Merckx et al., 2003; Roques et al., 2015). Cyc1 is important for cytokinesis in P. falciparum blood stage replication, possibly regulating the CDK7 homolog MRK (Robbins et al., 2017). P. berghei Cyc3 is dispensable for blood-stage replication but important for oocyst maturation in the mosquito midgut (Roques et al., 2015). The paucity of putative cyclins and the diversity of CDKs has led to suggestions that some of these kinases function without a cyclin partner (White and Suvorova, 2018)."

PMC7334637,2020-07-04,"Nonlinear dynamics of a time-delayed epidemic model with two explicit aware classes, saturated incidences, and treatment","Whenever a disease emerges, awareness in susceptibles prompts them to take preventive measures, which influence individuals’ behaviors. Therefore, we present and analyze a time-delayed epidemic model in which class of susceptible individuals is divided into three subclasses unaware susceptibles, fully aware susceptibles, and partially aware susceptibles to the disease, respectively, which emphasizes to consider three explicit incidences. The saturated type of incidence rates and treatment rate of infectives are deliberated herein. The mathematical analysis shows that the model has two equilibria disease-free and endemic. We derive the basic reproduction number [Formula see text] of the model and study the stability behavior of the model at both disease-free and endemic equilibria. Through analysis, it is demonstrated that the disease-free equilibrium is locally asymptotically stable when [Formula see text] , unstable when [Formula see text] , and linearly neutrally stable when [Formula see text] for the time delay [Formula see text] . Further, an undelayed epidemic model is studied when [Formula see text] , which reveals that the model exhibits forward and backward bifurcations under specific conditions, which also has important implications in the study of disease transmission dynamics. Moreover, we investigate the stability behavior of the endemic equilibrium and show that Hopf bifurcation occurs near endemic equilibrium when we choose time delay as a bifurcation parameter. Lastly, numerical simulations are performed in support of our analytical results.","The last two decades have seen several large-scale epidemics outbreaks such as Ebola, SARS, Zika virus, and swine flu, which leads to low socioeconomic status and inadequate access to health care. People get information about these outbreaks quite quickly due to significant advances in social media, which can have an insightful effect on the actual epidemic dynamics
[17, 31]. Therefore, at the beginning of an epidemic outbreak, the initial step is to make the individuals aware of the disease and its preventive methods. Awareness programs can alert the susceptible population toward the contagious disease
. If susceptible individuals have adequate knowledge and proper information about the infection, then they take precautionary measures such as regular hand sanitization, the use of face masks, wear hand gloves, vaccination, and even quarantine, which can reduce the impact of illness, for instance, ranging from the plague outbreak in the English village of Eyam in 1665–1666
, where the town completely sealed itself off to prevent further transmission of plague, to more recent outbreaks of swine influenza
 and Ebola
. In the situation of rural health services, the challenge of government health-care scheme is that there are numerous gaps in primary health services, and the health-care facilities are mainly urban centric. The rural residents may have low health knowledge awareness, and their receiving way of health knowledge can be traditional and straightforward. Knowledge level increases with higher education levels; therefore, one of the main factors is their education level. Therefore, a lot of people are not fully but partially aware of the spread and control of infectious diseases. Due to partial awareness, some individuals often medicate themselves adopting antibiotics, even when advised against doing so which weakens their immune system makes them at a high risk of catching the infection
. Therefore, complete awareness about the cycle of disease, along with the utilization of appropriate precautions and adequate decontamination procedures, is vital. Full awareness of the disease in humans develops a habit of taking precautionary measures against it, and they follow the instructions given by health workers and government and lower their risk of becoming infected. In the study of the transmission of infectious diseases, the incidence rate has a vital role as it determines the number of infectives per unit of time. In 1927, Kermack Mckendrick considered the bilinear incidence rate, which follows the law of mass action
. In the bilinear incidence rate, the number of infectives linearly increases, which might be real for a small population of infected individuals, but it is impractical for a large number of infectives. Therefore, several studies are devoted to consider nonlinear incidence rate for disease transmission dynamics (e.g.,

In addition to horizontal transmissions, vertical transmission within mosquito population is incorporated. Analysis of the mosquito-only component of the model shows that the reduced model has a mosquito-extinction equilibrium, which is globally-asymptotically stable whenever the basic offspring number [Formula see text] is less than unity. The vaccinated and type reproduction numbers of the full-model are computed. Condition for global-asymptotic stability of the disease-free equilibrium of the model when [Formula see text] is presented. It is shown that, fractional dosing of YF vaccine does not meet YF vaccination requirements. Optimal control theory is applied to the model to characterize the controls parameters. Using Pontryagin’s maximum principle and modified forward–backward sweep technique, the necessary conditions for existence of solutions to the optimal control problem is determined. Numerical simulations of the models to assess the effect of fractional vaccine dosing on the disease dynamics and global sensitivity analysis are presented.","Yellow fever (YF) is an acute viral haemorrhagic fever that is transmitted by mosquitoes of the Aedes and Haemogogus species. It is endemic in Africa, Central and South America, where approximately one billion people in fourty seven countries are at risk. Symptoms of the disease include fever, headache, jaundice, muscle pain, nausea, vomiting and fatigue 
[5, 44, 47, 48]. In broad terms, YF can either be jungle or urban. Jungle YF occurs in tropical rain-forest. In Africa, it is usually transmitted by Aedes africanus while in South America by Haemagogus species 
[6, 47, 48]. Urban YF is transmitted by Aedes aegypti, that it characterized by rapid amplification, capacity for international spread and has devastating effect on public health, socio-economic and political life 
. Once a mosquito is infected, it lives with the disease for the rest of its life and hence they can be considered as the reservoir for the virus. On the other hand, monkeys have brief viremia and can be considered to be amplifying hosts 
. Unfortunately, the threats posed by YF have largely been forgotten, just a bit more than a century ago, it was a source of terror, decimating populations of cities, destroying economies and driving political chaos. Extensive, repeated epidemics in North American and European port cities during the 18th and 19th centuries spread panic, shutting down affected cities and killing hundreds of thousands of people 
. Despite the availability of very effective YF vaccine, the disease has however continuously persist in Africa and South America, often with high mortality rate 
. In general terms, fourty seven countries are either YF endemic or have some regions that are YF endemic, thirty four of those countries are in Africa with thirteen in South and Central America. A modeling study based on African data sources estimated that, the burden of YF in the year 2013 was between 84,000 to 170,000 severe cases, and 29,000 to 60,000 deaths

PMC7364648,2020-03-03,Epidemiology of COVID-19,"COVID-19, an infectious respiratory illness caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome–corona virus 2 (SARS-CoV2), has now spread to multiple countries including India. The pace at which the disease spread in the last 4 months, since it was first recognized from China, is unprecedented. This review of the epidemiology of COVID-19 summarizes the burden of infection, transmission dynamics, and other related epidemiological features. While countries such as China, Italy, and the United States have particularly high-rates of infection, the disease is gradually spreading in India as well, threatening the health and economy of the country. Transmission in asymptomatic cases, early symptomatic phase, as well as limited access to testing in different settings are factors that have led to the rapid spread of infection. A large case series from China revealed that 81% of cases had mild symptoms, 14% had severe disease, and 5% were afflicted with critical illness. While the mortality in China was reported as 2.3%, Italy, with a high-proportion of elderly, reported a case fatality report of 7.2% due to higher infection and mortality rates among the elderly. Being a highly infectious disease, with a basic reproduction number between 2 to 3, COVID-19 is affecting a large number of healthcare workers, as evidenced by the fact that a sizeable portion of reported infections in the US included healthcare workers. Delivering health care for both COVID-19 affected individuals, as well those with other acute and chronic conditions, with limited access to healthcare facilities and services, are challenges for the health systems in low- and middle-income countries, which require immediate measures for health system strengthening across sectors.","Coronaviruses derive their name from the Latin word “corona” meaning crown. The name refers to the unique appearance of the virus under an electron microscope as round particles with a rim of projections resembling the solar corona. They are enveloped, positive-sense, single-stranded RNA viruses which were first isolated from humans in 1965.1 Coronavirus belongs to the family Coronaviridae which is known to produce mild respiratory diseases in humans. In recent times, there have been three major coronaviruses leading to disease outbreaks, beginning with the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS–CoV) in 2002, followed by the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS–CoV) in 2012, and now the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS–CoV2). In December 2019, China reported an outbreak of pneumonia of unknown causes in Wuhan, the capital city of Hubei province. Most of the early cases were epidemiologically linked to the Huanan seafood wholesale market where aquatic animals and live animals were sold.2 Using unbiased next-generation sequencing, an unknown betacoronavirus was discovered from lower respiratory tract samples of these patients. Human airway epithelial cells were used to isolate the virus that was named 2019–novel Coronavirus (2019–nCoV).3 The virus when observed under electron microscope had a diameter of 60 to 140 nm with characteristic spikes of 9 to 12 nm, similar to the Coronoviridae family.3 Phylogenetically, the novel coronavirus was found to be more similar to two bat derived coronavirus strains (~88% similarity) than coronaviruses which infect humans including SARS (~79% similarity) and MERS (~50% similarity).4 Based on phylogeny and taxonomy on February 11, 2020, the Coronaviridae study group of the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses named the virus as SARS–CoV2.5 The World Health Organization (WHO) named the resultant disease as Coronavirus disease (COVID-19).6 On March 11, 2020, WHO, after assessing the situation across the globe, declared COVID-19 as a pandemic (Fig. 1)."
PMC7376265,2020-05-22,An evaluation of mathematical models for the outbreak of COVID-19,"Mathematical modelling performs a vital part in estimating and controlling the recent outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). In this epidemic, most countries impose severe intervention measures to contain the spread of COVID-19. The policymakers are forced to make difficult decisions to leverage between health and economic development. How and when to make clinical and public health decisions in an epidemic situation is a challenging question. The most appropriate solution is based on scientific evidence, which is mainly dependent on data and models. So one of the most critical problems during this crisis is whether we can develop reliable epidemiological models to forecast the evolution of the virus and estimate the effectiveness of various intervention measures and their impacts on the economy. There are numerous types of mathematical model for epidemiological diseases. In this paper, we present some critical reviews on mathematical models for the outbreak of COVID-19. Some elementary models are presented as an initial formulation for an epidemic. We give some basic concepts, notations, and foundation for epidemiological modelling. More related works are also introduced and evaluated by considering epidemiological features such as disease tendency, latent effects, susceptibility, basic reproduction numbers, asymptomatic infections, herd immunity, and impact of the interventions.","The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), declared as a pandemic by the World Health Organization at the end of January 2020, is considered to be the most devastating infectious disease outbreak ever since the 1918 influenza pandemic. The first case of COVID-19 was reported on 31 December 2019 in Wuhan China, which was initially identified as the epicentre of the virus.1 Given it is apparently able to generate rapid and substantial human-to-human transmissions, COVID-19 has largely been spreading in vast geographic regions including more than 200 countries and severely hit countries such as Iran, Italy, Spain, France, Germany, UK, and US, etc. As of 19 April 2020, about 2 394 278 confirmed cases including more than 164 937 deaths had been reported worldwide according to the COVID-19 map by the Johns Hopkins University,2 which reveals that the epicentre is gradually moving to Europe and America. Even though serious measures were being undertaken by the vast majority of countries to contain the outbreak of COVID-19, it is still spreading globally in an overwhelming manner.3 In general, an epidemic follows a similar tendency, which can be modelled mathematically. Initially, the number of infected cases progressively increased, which usually exhibits exponential behaviour. On reaching the peak, it then turns over and gradually decreases. Ultimately, the outbreak fades out to zero, which implies the end of the epidemic. From the data in Ref. 4. we can observe from Fig. 1a that the infected cases in China started to grow in January 2020 and there was a sudden increase within a single day in February 2020 due to the change of diagnostic methods. Then the curve of China began to be saturated after early March. We can see from Fig. 2 that China and Republic of Korea seem to have been in the decreasing phase in April thanks to some serious preventive measures including lockdown of cities, closure of schools, shops and public transport, tracing and isolating infected individuals, and so on. These prevention measures lead to a sudden decline in transmission rate and turn out to be an effective strategy in containing the virus. For other countries, such as Italy, Spain, France, Germany, UK, and the US, we can observe from Fig. 1b that the number of cases is still in the rapid increase phase and some curves are still yet to reach the peak."
PMC7405720,2020-08-05,"Potential of combating transmission of COVID-19 using novel self-cleaning superhydrophobic surfaces: part II—thermal, chemical, and mechanical durability","In part I, we identified encapsulation, contamination suppression, and virus elimination as our three governing strategies for developing surfaces to combat the transmission and spread of COVID-19. We showed that our recent superhydrophobic nanocomposites has the potential of encapsulating and suppressing the virus so as to limit its transmission and spread. In this study, we examine the durability of the newly developed surfaces when subjected to elevated temperature, chemical attack and mechanical damage in the form of abrasion and compressive load. Extensive tests were conducted to reveal the effect of these parameters on the surface performance. Three aspects of the work were accordingly examined. The first was concerned with controlled thermal stability tests in which the surfaces were subjected to elevated temperatures approaching 350 °C for silicone-based nanocomposites and 150 °C for epoxy-based nanocomposites. The second was concerned with subjecting the surfaces to alkaline and acidic solutions with pH concentrations ranging between 1 and 13. Finally, the third involved surface damage by abrasion tests. Our results show clearly that the newly developed superhydrophobic surfaces are capable of resisting the adverse effects of thermal and chemical attacks as well as mechanical abrasion owing to the excellent structural stability and mechanical properties of the constituents of the nanocomposite. Moreover, our superhydrophobic monolith demonstrated exceptional regenerative capabilities even after being subjected to damaging compressive stresses of up to 10 MPa.","COVID-19 can be transmitted through airborne respiratory droplets, ejected as a result of coughing or sneezing through human contact with contaminated surfaces (Yang and Wang 2020; Gralinski and Menachery 2020). Recent studies by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (USA) have shown that the virus can infect fomites made of metals, polymers and recycled paper for days (Van Doremalen et al. 2020). Superhydrophobic surfaces have recently gained popularity in the biomedical sector due to their ability to possess blood repellency characteristics and reduce bacterial/viral adhesion to surfaces and their antifouling properties (Falde et al. 2016; Shin et al. 2016; Jaggessar et al. 2017). Earlier studies have shown that personal protective equipment (PPE) that have high contact angles (CA) and low sliding angles (SA) can significantly reduce a virus’s carryover potential and provide antimicrobial properties (Katoh et al. 2019; Tomšič et al. 2008; Yeerken et al. 2019)."
PMC7405757,2020-08-05,Potential of combating transmission of COVID-19 using novel self-cleaning superhydrophobic surfaces: part I—protection strategies against fomites,"According to the World Health Organisation, one of the main concerns of COVID-19 virus is its tenacity to spread from droplets that either land directly on a surface or are transmitted to a surface by an infected person. In this study, we report the potential of using superhydrophobic surfaces to combat the transmission and spread of fomites infected by COVID-19 virus strand. Fomites include clothes, utensils, furniture, regularly touched objects and personal protective equipment used by Health Care Workers to act as barriers against fluid transmission and/or fluid penetration. In this effort, we propose three strategies to combat the transmission and the spread of the virus encapsulation, contamination suppression, and elimination. We believe that this can be achieved by the use of our recently developed superhydrophobic coating and regenerative monolith to encapsulate and suppress the virus. The newly developed superhydrophobic coating and monolith are scalable, economical, and facile with the monolith capable of regeneration. The elimination of the virus will be through the use of antiviral and antibacterial copper nanoparticles or dedicated copper surfaces.","At the end of 2019, a debilitating and novel strand of coronavirus, known as COVID-19, emerged and progressed into an outbreak (Yang and Wang 2020; Munster et al. 2020). Soon after, the new disease, which put the lives and economic wellbeing of millions at risk, was declared a global pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO) (Yang and Wang 2020; Munster et al. 2020). Consequently, researchers worldwide devoted significant effort and time to discover a cure or an effective treatment in the form of drugs, vaccines, or antibody therapies. Equally as important is the search for engineering solutions that can help combat or reduce the virus transmission and protect the public and first responders from this infectious disease. COVID-19 can be transmitted through airborne respiratory droplets, ejected as a result of talking, coughing or sneezing, as well as through human contact with fomites (Yang and Wang 2020; Gralinski and Menachery 2020). Fomites represent a major health concern due to their ability to spread the virus when exposed to contaminated respiratory droplets or other body fluids, such as saliva, nasal discharge, or blood, from an infected person (Ong et al. 2020). Recent studies by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (USA) have shown that the virus can infect fomites made of metals, polymers and recycled paper for extended periods measured in days (Van Doremalen et al. 2020). For instance, contaminated commonly used surfaces that exist in public facilities, such as furniture, clothes, utensils, handrails, taps, sinks, elevator buttons, and light switches, among others, can easily transmit the virus. In addition, according to the WHO guidelines (Van Doremalen et al. 2020), Health Care Workers (HCW) should be equipped with personal protective equipment (PPE), such as gowns, coveralls, face shields, or masks, to act as a barrier against fluid transmission and/or fluid penetration. However, infections due to the adhesion of bodily fluids to the surface of PPE during doffing or undressing have previously been reported in (Katoh et al. 2019; Galante et al. 2020; Tanabe et al. 2020), which represents a serious risk of virus transmission among HCW. This risk has been further demonstrated by the numerous COVID-19 infections reported among HCW (Bowdle and Munoz-Price 2020; Wang et al. 2020). It is worth noting that during the SARS outbreak in 2003, 51% of the cases in Ontario (Canada) were among HCW (Bowdle and Munoz-Price 2020). Accordingly, novel strategies should be sought to reduce the risk of virus transmission among the public and first responders."
PMC7438179,2020-08-20,Seasonal influenza vaccination in Kenya: an economic evaluation using dynamic transmission modelling," There is substantial burden of seasonal influenza in Kenya, which led the government to consider introducing a national influenza vaccination programme. Given the cost implications of a nationwide programme, local economic evaluation data are needed to inform policy on the design and benefits of influenza vaccination. We set out to estimate the cost-effectiveness of seasonal influenza vaccination in Kenya. METHODS We fitted an age-stratified dynamic transmission model to active surveillance data from patients with influenza from 2010 to 2018. Using a societal perspective, we developed a decision tree cost-effectiveness model and estimated the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) per disability-adjusted life year (DALY) averted for three vaccine target groups children 6–23 months (strategy I), 2–5 years (strategy II) and 6–14 years (strategy III) with either the Southern Hemisphere influenza vaccine (Strategy A) or Northern Hemisphere vaccine (Strategy B) or both (Strategy C twice yearly vaccination campaigns, or Strategy D year-round vaccination campaigns). We assessed cost-effectiveness by calculating incremental net monetary benefits (INMB) using a willingness-to-pay (WTP) threshold of 1–51% of the annual gross domestic product per capita ($17–$872). RESULTS The mean number of infections across all ages was 2–15 million per year. When vaccination was well timed to influenza activity, the annual mean ICER per DALY averted for vaccinating children 6–23 months ranged between $749 and $1385 for strategy IA, $442 and $1877 for strategy IB, $678 and $4106 for strategy IC and $1147 and $7933 for strategy ID. For children 2–5 years, it ranged between $945 and $1573 for strategy IIA, $563 and $1869 for strategy IIB, $662 and $4085 for strategy IIC, and $1169 and $7897 for strategy IID. For children 6–14 years, it ranged between $923 and $3116 for strategy IIIA, $1005 and $2223 for strategy IIIB, $883 and $4727 for strategy IIIC and $1467 and $6813 for strategy IIID. Overall, no vaccination strategy was cost-effective at the minimum ($17) and median ($445) WTP thresholds. Vaccinating children 6–23 months once a year had the highest mean INMB value at $872 (WTP threshold upper limit); however, this strategy had very low probability of the highest net benefit. CONCLUSION Vaccinating children 6–23 months once a year was the most favourable vaccination option; however, the strategy is unlikely to be cost-effective given the current WTP thresholds.","Influenza is an important cause of respiratory illness in Kenya, especially in children under 5 and, in particular, young children under 2 [1, 2]. In 2016, the Kenya National Immunisation Technical Advisory Group (KENITAG) recommended annual seasonal influenza vaccination for children 6–23 months of age . KENITAG further recommended pilot projects to generate additional local data to inform implementation of a nationwide influenza vaccination policy. In particular, KENITAG requested that local evidence be generated on influenza vaccine cost-effectiveness, because their recommendation largely relied on studies in non-African countries [4–6]. Given the cost implications of a nationwide programme, local economic evaluation data are needed to inform policy on the design and benefits of influenza vaccination in Kenya. In countries with year-round influenza activity, the World Health Organization (WHO) recommends vaccination with the most recent influenza vaccine formulation before the primary peak in influenza activity [7, 8]. In Kenya, cases are observed year round , with an equal number of cases occurring during the Northern Hemisphere (NH) and Southern Hemisphere (SH) seasons . There are no published influenza vaccine cost-effectiveness studies in Kenya. In other tropical settings with year-round influenza transmission, there is some quantification of the effect of elderly vaccination , but no evidence of the impact of vaccinating children."
PMC7447585,2020-08-26,Differential contribution of Anopheles coustani and Anopheles arabiensis to the transmission of Plasmodium falciparum and Plasmodium vivax in two neighbouring villages of Madagascar," Malaria is still a heavy public health concern in Madagascar. Few studies combining parasitology and entomology have been conducted despite the need for accurate information to design effective vector control measures. In a Malagasy region of moderate to intense transmission of both Plasmodium falciparum and P. vivax, parasitology and entomology have been combined to survey malaria transmission in two nearby villages. METHODS Community-based surveys were conducted in the villages of Ambohitromby and Miarinarivo at three time points (T1, T2 and T3) during a single malaria transmission season. Human malaria prevalence was determined by rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs), microscopy and real-time PCR. Mosquitoes were collected by human landing catches and pyrethrum spray catches and the presence of Plasmodium sporozoites was assessed by TaqMan assay. RESULTS Malaria prevalence was not significantly different between villages, with an average of 8.0% by RDT, 4.8% by microscopy and 11.9% by PCR. This was mainly due to P. falciparum and to a lesser extent to P. vivax. However, there was a significantly higher prevalence rate as determined by PCR at T2 ([Formula see text] = 7.46, P = 0.025). Likewise, mosquitoes were significantly more abundant at T2 ([Formula see text] = 64.8, P < 0.001), especially in Ambohitromby. At T1 and T3 mosquito abundance was higher in Miarinarivo than in Ambohitromby ([Formula see text] = 14.92, P < 0.001). Of 1550 Anopheles mosquitoes tested, 28 (1.8%) were found carrying Plasmodium sporozoites. The entomological inoculation rate revealed that Anopheles coustani played a major contribution in malaria transmission in Miarinarivo, being responsible of 61.2 infective bites per human (ib/h) during the whole six months of the survey, whereas, it was An. arabiensis, with 36 ib/h, that played that role in Ambohitromby. CONCLUSIONS Despite a similar malaria prevalence in two nearby villages, the entomological survey showed a different contribution of An. coustani and An. arabiensis to malaria transmission in each village. Importantly, the suspected secondary malaria vector An. coustani, was found playing the major role in malaria transmission in one village. This highlights the importance of combining parasitology and entomology surveys for better targeting local malaria vectors. Such study should contribute to the malaria pre-elimination goal established under the 2018–2022 National Malaria Strategic Plan. [Image see text]","Malaria remains a major public health concern in Madagascar, with an increase in the number of cases and deaths in years 2017 and 2018, compared to the year 2016 . Malaria epidemiology in Madagascar is highly heterogenous and varies according to the climatic and ecological environment that allows a stratification in bioclimatic zones and ecozones [2, 3]. All four human malaria species are circulating, with Plasmodium falciparum being the most prevalent. Across the ecozones, the average prevalence of P. falciparum varies from 2 to 12%  but can reach 30% in some areas . Among the 26 Anopheles species described in the country, six have been reported as malaria vectors with different role according to geography and behaviour . Three species belong to the Anopheles gambiae complex Anopheles gambiae (sensu stricto), An. arabiensis and An. merus, the latter having a minor role in malaria transmission and being restricted to the most southern region of Madagascar . Of the two other members of the An. gambiae complex, An. arabiensis is prevalent throughout Madagascar and plays a major role in malaria transmission along with An. funestus . Anopheles mascarensis, endemic to Madagascar, and An. coustani, act as local or minor vectors [8–10]. Recent surveys of malaria incidence and prevalence between 2010–2016 confirm the heavy malaria burden for the population living in the western part of Madagascar [3, 4, 11]. In the Tsiroanomandidy district which constitutes a bridge area between the low transmission Central Highlands and the high endemic western region, both P. falciparum and P. vivax circulate. In this area, malaria prevalence and Anopheles species distribution have been described in detail [7, 12, 13]. Such combined parasitological and entomological information is critical for developing effective strategies for interrupting malaria transmission and moving towards malaria elimination which has been set up on the agenda of the 2018–2022 Malagasy Malaria Strategic Plan as geographically progressive elimination. Toward this goal, is reported here a combined parasitological and entomological survey in the Maevatanana district, located in the northwestern ecozone of Madagascar, and which faces a high malaria burden due to both P. falciparum and P. vivax. The study was conducted in two neighbouring villages in Andriba, a rural commune located at the transition between the western fringe of the Central Highlands (low malaria prevalence) and the northwestern ecozone (moderate to high prevalence) according to Howes et al. . The main goal of this study was to determine which Anopheles species contribute to the local malaria transmission with the aim for providing targeted vector control recommendation to the local authorities. To our knowledge, no such combined parasitological and entomological survey has ever been performed in that region."
PMC7445076,2020-08-25,"Dynamics and risk assessment of SARS-CoV-2 in urban areas: a geographical assessment on Kolkata Municipal Corporation, India","SARS-CoV-2 has been transmitted and outbreak took place in India during the last week before nationwide 1st lockdown took place. Urban areas found more vulnerable and reported nearly 65% of cases during every phase of lockdown. Mumbai, among four metropolitan cities found huge number of containment zones with nearly 30% of SARS-CoV-2 cases indicating clustering of cases. Most of the containment zones of SARS-CoV-2 cases in Kolkata Municipal Corporation found a significant relation with slum areas. The study primarily tries considering the nature of SARS-CoV-2 cases in different urban centres with the help of cartographic techniques. AHP method has been used to determine the factors responsible for such concentration of SARS-CoV-2 cases with vulnerability assessment (exposure, sensitivity and resilience) and risks. Before nationwide lockdown starts, the share of urban centres found 25% which has been transformed into nearly 60% at the end of 3(rd) phase of lockdown. Growth rate of SARS-CoV-2 cases found very high for Chennai and Thane with less number of doubling time to nation. Slum concentration and containment density shows a higher degree of correlation in Kolkata Municipal Corporation. Risk map also shows the concentration of cases in central and north Kolkata with higher degree of diseases exposure and sensitivity. Control measures must be taken by the central and state Government to minimise the transmission rate of SARS-CoV-2 mainly urban areas. As urban area contributing a higher share of SARS-CoV-2 cases, a proper management plan must be enforce. ELECTRONIC SUPPLEMENTARY MATERIAL The online version of this article (10.1007/s41324-020-00354-6) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.","In the present day context urbanisation becomes a major driver of demographic change of an area. According to United Nations report, world’s population living in the urban areas has grown from 43 to 55% during 1990 to 2015 [1, 2]. By 2050, it has been estimated that the world’s 70% population will be reside in urban areas. This kind of urban growth and population concentration leads to sprawling and shanty development outside and within the city respectively. High population density, low per capita spacing, concentration of urban poor make significant impact on the epidemiology of the infectious diseases [3, 4]. Association between urban poor and risk of pathogen transmission is very high in this scenario. High human to human propagation can easily be spike with such vulnerable condition . Presently, more than 900 million populations in the world are living in slums whereas the figure of India is nearly 104 million . In 1990, worldwide figure of slum populations were nearly 689 million which has been booming to 792 million in next 10 years i.e. in 2000 . In the current worldwide pandemic situation of SARS-CoV-2, growth pattern, transmission nature and driving factors are the key aspects need to study. December 31, 2019 an outbreak of COVID-19 (as known earlier) has been reported from Wuhan city of Hubei province in mainland China and rapidly spread into the other provinces of China along with 24 countries within end of January, 2020 . Wuhan city has been under full lockdown (travel ban and closure of everything except essential services) from 23 January 2020 . But the decision has been taken by the government was too late as the by Novel Coronavirus (nCoV-19) infections has already transmitted in different parts of mainland China and also in the different countries of the World. This episode is highly correlated with the Chinese Great Migration during the January–February when near about 415 million people are moving towards mainland China (within the Country and from outside the country) to celebrate their Lunar New Year. From mid-February countries of European continent, U.S.A, Australia facing a terrible spike of SARS-CoV-2 cases which has been not affected India at a large till the end of March, 2020. Nearly 4.9 million populations has been affected by SARS-CoV-2 and the fatality has reached into 0.32 million (as on 19-05-2020). Several countries like United States, Russia, Brazil, Italy, France, United Kingdom, Germany, Turkey, Iran has faced a major setback due the this pandemic [10, 11]. India has also reached the mark of 100,000 confirmed SARS-CoV-2 cases after 64 days of first case found. Though the time taken by India to reach one lack infected cases much higher than the other countries, but the exponential triggering has been noticed during last week of 3rd phase of nationwide lockdown (from 4 May, 2020 to 17 May, 2020). Nearly 85% cases are reported from major cities of India and most interestingly, Mumbai, Delhi, Ahmedabad, Chennai, Thane, Pune, Kolkata become the most contributing urban centres to SARS-CoV-2 cases (as on 19 May, 2020). High population density and higher concentration of slum population make an interruption for maintaining the social distancing and lockdown effectively [12–14]. Considering such backdrop the nature of spreading of SARS-CoV-2 cases in the Indian cities need to be analysed. Further an attempt has also been made to quantify and assess the hotspot zones along with risks of the concentrated areas of Kolkata (one of the Metro city) for proper understanding of transmission of diseases in the congested and unhealthy places as a case study [9, 15, 16]."
PMC7487074,2020-09-13,Traveling Waves and Estimation of Minimal Wave Speed for a Diffusive Influenza Model with Multiple Strains,"Antiviral treatment remains one of the key pharmacological interventions against influenza pandemic. However, widespread use of antiviral drugs brings with it the danger of drug resistance evolution. To assess the risk of the emergence and diffusion of resistance, in this paper, we develop a diffusive influenza model where influenza infection involves both drug-sensitive and drug-resistant strains. We first analyze its corresponding reaction model, whose reproduction numbers and equilibria are derived. The results show that the sensitive strains can be eliminated by treatment. Then, we establish the existence of the three kinds of traveling waves starting from the disease-free equilibrium, i.e., semi-traveling waves, strong traveling waves and persistent traveling waves, from which we can get some useful information (such as whether influenza will spread, asymptotic speed of propagation, the final state of the wavefront). On the other hand, we discuss three situations in which semi-traveling waves do not exist. When the control reproduction number [Formula see text] is larger than 1, the conditions for the existence and nonexistence of traveling waves are determined completely by the reproduction numbers [Formula see text] , [Formula see text] and the wave speed c. Meanwhile, we give an interval estimation of minimal wave speed for influenza transmission, which has important guiding significance for the control of influenza in reality. Our findings demonstrate that the control of influenza depends not only on the rates of resistance emergence and transmission during treatment, but also on the diffusion rates of influenza strains, which have been overlooked in previous modeling studies. This suggests that antiviral treatment should be implemented appropriately, and infected individuals (especially with the resistant strain) should be tested and controlled effectively. Finally, we outline some future directions that deserve further investigation.","Influenza is a serious cytopathogenic, drastic respiratory infectious disease that is caused by an RNA virus in the Orthomyxoviridae family (Earn et al. 2002; Möhler et al. 2005). Based on the differences in two major internal proteins, matrix protein (M) and nucleoprotein (NP), the virus is categorized into three main types A, B and C (Webster et al. 1992; Tamura et al. 2005). Influenza virus can be transmitted among human beings in various ways, such as direct contact with infectious individuals, by contact with contaminated objects, by inhalation of virus-laden aerosols, etc (Viboud et al. 2004). In fact, human influenza, a more severe disease, has been a major cause of excessive morbidity and mortality 40 million in Spanish flu (H1N1) 1918–1919 (Oxford 2000) and a total of 6 million in Asian flu (H2N2) 1957–1958 and Hong-Kong flu (H3N2) 1968 (Stone et al. 2007). In particular, the outbreak of 2009 H1N1 flu (swine flu) has proved again that influenza can be a serious problem worldwide (Garten et al. 2009). In addition, influenza poses a considerable economic burden of society and becomes a problem of public health (Webster et al. 1992). Therefore, it is imperative to study how to prevent and contain the outbreak of influenza, increasing our understanding of the influenza transmission dynamics."
PMC7491600,2020-09-15,Initial value estimation of uncertain differential equations and zero-day of COVID-19 spread in China,"Assume an uncertain process follows an uncertain differential equation, and some realizations of this process are observed. Parameter estimation for the uncertain differential equation that fits the observed data as much as possible is a core problem in practice. This paper first presents a problem of initial value estimation for uncertain differential equations and proposes an estimation method. In addition, the method of moments is recast for estimating the time-varying parameters in uncertain differential equations. Using those techniques, a COVID-19 spread model based on uncertain differential equation is derived, and the zero-day of COVID-19 spread in China is inferred.","Based on uncertainty theory (Liu 2007), Liu  initialized uncertain differential equation as a type of differential equations involving uncertain processes. Under linear growth and Lipschitz condition, Chen and Liu  proved an existence and uniqueness theorem of solution of uncertain differential equation. Following that, Gao  proved the theorem again under local linear growth and Lipschitz condition. Furthermore, an analytic solution to linear uncertain differential equations was derived by Chen and Liu , and some analytic methods to nonlinear uncertain differential equations were presented by Liu  and Yao (2013b). Yao and Chen  made an important contribution for verifying that the solution of an uncertain differential equation can be represented by a family of solutions of ordinary differential equations (this important work was named as Yao–Chen Formula later), and then the methods for calculating extreme value, first hitting time and time integral of the solution of uncertain differential equation were provided by Yao (2013a). To estimate the unknown parameters in uncertain differential equation that fits the observed data as much as possible, several methods were proposed, for example, the method of moments (Yao and Liu 2020), least squares estimation (Sheng et al. 2019), generalized moment estimation (Liu 2020b), uncertain maximum likelihood (Liu and Liu 2020), and minimum cover estimation (Yang et al. 2020). Recently, many scholars applied uncertain statistics to modelling COVID-19 pandemic. For instance, Liu (2020a) used uncertain regression analysis to forecast the cumulative numbers of COVID-19 infections in China, while Ye and Yang  used uncertain time series. Following that, Chen et al.  presented an uncertain SIR model, and Jia and Chen  proposed an uncertain SEIAR model by employing high-dimensional uncertain differential equations."
PMC7499786,2020-08-29,A workable strategy for COVID-19 testing: stratified periodic testing rather than universal random testing,"This paper argues for the regular testing of people in groups that are more likely to be exposed to SARS-CoV-2, to reduce the spread of COVID-19 and resume economic activity. We call this ‘stratified periodic testing’. It is ‘stratified’ as it is based on at-risk groups, and ‘periodic’ as everyone in the group is tested at regular intervals. We argue that this is a better use of scarce testing resources than ‘universal random testing’, as has been recently discussed globally. We find that, under reasonable assumptions and allowing for false negative results 30 per cent of the time, 17 per cent of a subgroup would need to be tested each day to lower the effective reproduction number R from 2.5 to 0.75, under stratified periodic testing. Using the same assumptions the universal random testing rate would need to be 27 per cent (as opposed to 7 per cent as argued by Romer (2020b)). We obtain this rate of testing using a corrected method for calculating the impact of an infectious person on others, and allowing for asymptomatic cases. We also find that the effect of one day’s delay between testing positive and self-isolating is similar to having a test that is 30 per cent less accurate.","Governments around the world are looking for a testing strategy for COVID-19; one that will ensure that the escape from lockdown is as fast as possible, given a certain level of safety. This strategy will inevitably be constrained by our testing capacity every person in the world cannot be tested every day. Given these constraints, we argue that ‘stratified periodic testing’ is an efficient way of using scarce testing resources, and provides a way for calculating the frequency of testing needed to stop the spread of the virus within a particular group. We also argue that our method is more efficient than ‘universal random testing’, which has been widely discussed since it was proposed by Romer (2020b). Our proposal is ‘stratified’ because it focuses testing on groups who are at particular risk of spreading the infection. This may be because they have a high basic reproduction number, R0, to begin with, like healthcare workers. Or, it may be because they have a high reproduction number because of the way lockdown has been unevenly applied, for example delivery drivers remaining active. The choice of groups may also take into account fatality rates if they were to spread the virus (like those in care homes for the elderly), or the economic impact if the group needed to be isolated (as discussed by Kasy and Teytelboym ). Constraints on testing capacity mean that this is a more workable and efficient solution than testing the entire population."

Corona virus is transmissible and spreading from person to person, while the Chinese commanded authorities are scrambling to treat a flood of new patients in Chines successfully. The said Corona virus has been spread from an initial outbreak in Wuhan, city of China, and invade 25 other worldwide countries. In this article, we considered the mathematical model (Chen et al.

PMC7533478,2020-08-24,Social stigmatisation among COVID-19 patients: addressing a potential source of COVID-19 transmission to healthcare staff in cardiac emergency and cardiac care units,"During our routine work, we noticed an increased incidence of COVID-19 diagnoses among patients in the cardiac unit, which led to an exponential increase in COVID-19 cases among hospital staff. We found that patients hid their symptoms from the emergency doctors and attributed those symptoms to cardiac or other causes. Social stigmatisation appeared to be the root cause for hiding their symptoms. Hence, we recommended a strategy to introduce psychological counselling of patients who were suspected to be infected with COVID-19, with a normal cardiac workup to overcome social stigmatisation and save our general wards from COVID-19.","We are currently posted in a 1900-bed tertiary care hospital in Karachi, Pakistan, where a 350-bed COVID-19 isolation unit and intensive care unit (ICU) have been set up. During the 4 months after the first case of COVID-19 was reported in Pakistan (on 26 February 2020), a wave of fear developed across the country. Awareness campaigns regarding the symptoms of COVID-19 were launched by the government on television and in the print media. The major objective of those campaigns was to decrease the number of COVID-19 cases by educating the population. However, a new trend was reported while we were working in the COVID-19 isolation unit and intensive care unit (ICU). A higher than routine number of patients were being transferred from the cardiac emergency unit and the cardiac care unit (CCU) to the COVID-19 isolation unit and ICU. It was seen that patients who had a cough, fever or shortness of breath were hiding their symptoms to avoid discrimination and, on inquiry, they believed that they would not have been treated by healthcare workers if they had revealed their symptoms. This led to a higher incidence of healthcare staff being tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 in the cardiac emergency unit and CCU. This misbelief, which prevails in society and seems to be the reason behind the misconception of discrimination, is a major hurdle faced by healthcare workers in cardiac emergency units and CCUs. This social reaction causes difficulty in the diagnosis of patients who have COVID-19 symptoms and may have a detrimental effect on efforts to limit the spread of the disease, as well as putting the lives of healthcare workers in non-COVID-19 critical care units, ICUs and CCUs in danger.2 Our observations led us to the conclusion that we should focus on stigmatisation along with the treatment of COVID-19. Hence, we prospectively started a 2 min counselling session for all patients who were attributing their symptoms to cardiac disease without any sound findings on cardiac investigations in the cardiac emergency unit. The counselling points were designed after a detailed discussion with a psychologist and psychiatrist. The counselling session addressed the following issues

PMC7539278,2020-10-07,Energy transmission in mechanically ventilated children: a translational study," Recurrent delivery of tidal mechanical energy (ME) inflicts ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI) when stress and strain exceed the limits of tissue tolerance. Mechanical power (MP) is the mathematical description of the ME delivered to the respiratory system over time. It is unknown how ME relates to underlying lung pathology and outcome in mechanically ventilated children. We therefore tested the hypothesis that ME per breath with tidal volume (Vt) normalized to bodyweight correlates with underlying lung pathology and to study the effect of resistance on the ME dissipated to the lung. METHODS We analyzed routinely collected demographic, physiological, and laboratory data from deeply sedated and/or paralyzed children < 18 years with and without lung injury. Patients were stratified into respiratory system mechanic subgroups according to the Pediatric Mechanical Ventilation Consensus Conference (PEMVECC) definition. The association between MP, ME, lung pathology, and duration of mechanical ventilation as a primary outcome measure was analyzed adjusting for confounding variables and effect modifiers. The effect of endotracheal tube diameter (ETT) and airway resistance on energy dissipation to the lung was analyzed in a bench model with different lung compliance settings. RESULTS Data of 312 patients with a median age of 7.8 (1.7–44.2) months was analyzed. Age (p < 0.001), RR p < 0.001), and Vt < 0.001) were independently associated with MPrs. ME but not MP correlated significantly (p < 0.001) better with lung pathology. Competing risk regression analysis adjusting for PRISM III 24 h score and PEMVECC stratification showed that ME on day 1 or day 2 of MV but not MP was independently associated with the duration of mechanical ventilation. About 33% of all energy generated by the ventilator was transferred to the lung and highly dependent on lung compliance and airway resistance but not on endotracheal tube size (ETT) during pressure control (PC) ventilation. CONCLUSIONS ME better related to underlying lung pathology and patient outcome than MP. The delivery of generated energy to the lung was not dependent on ETT size during PC ventilation. Further studies are needed to identify injurious MErs thresholds in ventilated children.","Mechanical ventilation (MV) as life-saving intervention is ubiquitous in pediatric intensive care units (PICU) but may simultaneously lead to ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI) . Experimental and clinical studies have identified factors contributing to VILI to include volutrauma (i.e., delivery of large tidal volumes (Vt) as a surrogate for lung strain), lung stress, and atelectrauma (i.e., the repetitive opening and closure of alveoli) albeit that their exact role in the pediatric setting is not well understood [1, 2]. Mechanical power (MPrs) has been proposed as a measure and potential driver of VILI . MPrs is the energy per breathing cycle multiplied by ventilation frequency . It can be calculated during volume-controlled (VC) ventilation using the respiratory rate (RR), peak inspiratory pressure (PIP), plateau pressure (Pplat), and positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) . Although MPrs has been associated with mortality in ARDS patients, it is not well-established if MPrs should be normalized to lung volume or predicted bodyweight and how much power is delivered to the lung [3, 6–8]."
PMC7556571,2020-10-14,"Evidence of vector borne transmission of Salmonella enterica enterica serovar Gallinarum and fowl typhoid disease mediated by the poultry red mite, Dermanyssus gallinae (De Geer, 1778)"," The poultry red mite Dermanyssus gallinae (De Geer, 1778) is a major ectoparasite of poultry. Infestations are found in most laying hen farms in Europe, and breeder flocks have also been reported to be affected. Mite infestation has detrimental effects on animal welfare, it causes significant economic losses, and, additionally, D. gallinae is often considered as a vector for pathogens. Despite suspicion of a close relationship between the poultry red mite and Salmonella enterica enterica serovar Gallinarum biovar Gallinarum (serovar Gallinarum), the causative agent of fowl typhoid disease (FT), there has been no definitive proof of mite-mediated transmission. Therefore, an investigation was conducted to determine if D. gallinae-mediated transmission of serovar Gallinarum could be demonstrated among four different hen groups. METHODS Two groups of 8 hens (A and B) were experimentally infected with serovar Gallinarum in two isolators. After 7 days, when birds showed signs of FT, about 25,000 mites were introduced. After 3 days, mites were harvested and used to infest two other hen groups of 8 (C and D), in two separate isolators. The health status of hens was constantly monitored; detection and quantification of serovar Gallinarum were performed by PCR and qPCR from mites and organs of dead hens. The maximum likelihood estimation of the infection rate and mite vectorial capacity were calculated. RESULTS Clinical disease was observed in groups infected with serovar Gallinarum (A and B) and in hens of groups C and D infested with mites harvested from the isolators containing groups A and B. In all four groups, serovar Gallinarum was detected from liver, spleen, ovary, and cecum of hens, thus confirming the diagnosis of FT. Mite analysis demonstrated the presence of the pathogen, with an estimated infection rate ranging between 13.72 and 55.21 infected per thousand mites. Vectorial capacity was estimated to be 73.79. CONCLUSIONS Mites harvested from birds infected with serovar Gallinarum were shown to carry the mite, and then to transfer serovar Gallinarum to isolated groups of pathogen-free birds that subsequently showed signs of FT. Mite vectorial capacity was high, demonstrating that D. gallinae should be considered an effective vector of FT. [Image see text]","The poultry red mite (PRM) Dermanyssus gallinae (De Geer, 1778) is a hematophagous ectoparasite of poultry that has a heavy impact on poultry farms worldwide . Its life-cycle, which consists of one non-feeding stage (larva) and three blood-sucking stages (protonymph, deutonymph, and adult, both male and female), usually occurs in two weeks or even less . The effects of infestation on chickens include severe stress, irritation, reduction in weight gain, and even death in case of massive infestation . Detrimental effects are also observed in the quantity  and quality  of egg production. Overall, the costs associated with treatment, preventive measures, and lost working days have been estimated at about 231 M€ per year in the EU . Beyond the direct effects, many studies have surmised the role of D. gallinae as a vector of pathogens . Association with D. gallinae has been reported for several viral and bacterial species, such as avian influenza virus , Erysipelothrix rhusiopathiae , Chlamydia psittaci , Coxiella burnetii and Borrelia burgdorferi (s.l.) . However, very few publications report the actual demonstration of transmission of pathogens mediated by the poultry red mite. Studies by Valiente Moro et al.

PMC7561616,2020-11-03,Managing the spread of disease with mobile phone data,"While human mobility has important benefits for economic growth, it can generate negative externalities. This paper studies the effect of mobility on the spread of disease in a low-incidence setting when people do not internalize their risks to others. Using malaria as a case study and 15 billion mobile phone records across nine million SIM cards, this paper quantifies the relationship between travel and the spread of disease. The estimates indicate that an infected traveler contributes to 1.66 additional cases reported in the health facility at the traveler's destination. This paper develops a simulation-based policy tool that uses mobile phone data to inform strategic targeting of travelers based on their origins and destinations. The simulations suggest that targeting informed by mobile phone data could reduce the caseload by 50 percent more than current strategies that rely only on previous incidence.","Increasing domestic and international mobility has magnified the devastating consequences of infectious diseases more than 11,000 deaths from Ebola, 440,000–1,300,000 cases of Zika infections in 13 countries, and most recently, over 21.2 million infections and 761,000 deaths from COVID-191 across 188 countries and territories (Bogoch et al., 2016; WHO, 2020a; WHO, 2020b). Negative externalities from mobility are also relevant for long-standing diseases that society is working to eliminate. For example, Venezuela, the first country certified by the World Health Organization (WHO) for eliminating malaria in its most populated areas in 1961, experienced a dramatic resurgence of the disease in 2016, in part due to migrant workers in the mining region becoming sick, traveling home, and spreading the disease to their home villages and cities (Casey, 2016). This paper uses a case study of malaria in Senegal to demonstrate how to harness big data to estimate the size of this externality of movement and apply the results toward more effective policy targeting. The method can be applied more broadly to inform policies related to mitigating the spread of infectious diseases. The economics literature identifies malaria eradication as having important impacts on adult income and consumption (Bleakley, 2010; Cutler et al., 2010; Venkataramani, 2012), real estate wealth (Hong, 2011), long term health including chronic disease and disability (Hong, 2013), and test scores and educational attainment (Barofsky et al., 2015; Lucas, 2010; Venkataramani, 2012).2 Ninety-nine countries have been certified by the WHO as malaria free; however, Sub-Saharan Africa, which accounted for 93 percent of all malaria deaths in 2018, has only had a single successful case of elimination (WHO, 2019). Previous work has studied malaria prevention/treatment in short-term settings, focusing on the pricing of malaria interventions (Cohen and Dupas, 2010; Cohen et al., 2015; Dupas, 2014; Laxminarayan et al., 2010; Tarozzi et al., 2014) and the adoption of preventative or antimalarial treatment (Adhvaryu, 2014; Apouey et al., 2018; Armand et al., 2017). There has been limited economics research examining the persistence of the disease and factors related to maintaining areas disease-free once elimination is accomplished in the short-term."
PMC7610176,2020-10-13,Implication of backward contact tracing in the presence of overdispersed transmission in COVID-19 outbreaks,"Introduction Contact tracing has the potential to control outbreaks without the need for stringent physical distancing policies, e.g. civil lockdowns. Unlike forward contact tracing, backward contact tracing identifies the source of newly detected cases. This approach is particularly valuable when there is high individual-level variation in the number of secondary transmissions (overdispersion). Methods By using a simple branching process model, we explored the potential of combining backward contact tracing with more conventional forward contact tracing for control of COVID-19. We estimated the typical size of clusters that can be reached by backward tracing and simulated the incremental effectiveness of combining backward tracing with conventional forward tracing. Results Across ranges of parameter values consistent with dynamics of SARS-CoV-2, backward tracing is expected to identify a primary case generating 3-10 times more infections than average, typically increasing the proportion of subsequent cases averted by a factor of 2-3. The estimated number of cases averted by backward tracing became greater with a higher degree of overdispersion. Conclusion Backward contact tracing can be an effective tool for outbreak control, especially in the presence of overdispersion as was observed with SARS-CoV-2.","Isolation of symptomatic cases and tracing and quarantine of their contacts is a staple public health control measure, and has the potential to prevent the need for stringent physical distancing policies that result in detrimental impacts on the society (e.g., civil lockdowns)
1,
2. By identifying and quarantining those who have been recently in contact with infected individuals, epidemic control may be achieved without broad restrictions on the general population. Contact tracing is typically triggered by a confirmed index case identified via symptom-based surveillance. Contacts of this index case are identified via interviews by public health officials (manual contact tracing) or by tracking proximity records on digital devices (digital contact tracing), and asked to quarantine in order to prevent further transmissions. Contact tracing often targets ‘downstream’ individuals, who may have been infected by the index case (‘forward tracing’); i.e. those who have been in contact with the index case after the index case likely became infectious (often assumed as 2 days before illness onset for COVID-19
3,
4). However, ‘backward tracing’ can also be used to identify the upstream primary case who infected the index case (or a setting or event at which the index case was infected) by retracing history of contact to the likely point of exposure up to the upper bound of incubation period. For example, contact history of 14 days prior to symptom onset is collected in Japan, where backward tracing has been operated from the early phase of the COVID-19 outbreak

6. If this primary case is identified, a larger fraction of the transmission chain can be detected by forward tracing each of the contacts of this primary case."
PMC7662027,2020-11-13,"Dear supplier, how sustainable are you?: A multiple-case study analysis of a widespread tool for sustainable supply chain management","This article analyses one of the most common tools employed by global focal companies in sustainable supply chain management (SSCM) across all industries supplier sustainability self-assessment questionnaires. Extant research has moved beyond the questions of whether and which suppliers should be assessed. Current research is already focussing on how to share and standardise such assessment data. Despite mounting general research on SSCM, we identified that specific tools such as self-assessment questionnaires have not been empirically analysed in SSCM literature. Thus, this paper addresses the research questions of what differences there are among supplier self-assessment questionnaires and how supplier responses to such questionnaires might be influenced. Our research involves an abductive multiple-case study design and an analysis of over 25,000 responses from globally dispersed suppliers to two types of supplier sustainability self-assessment questionnaires administered and requested by a global automotive focal company. Although the two questionnaires covered similar areas of sustainability practices and were administered to suppliers of the same focal company, the suppliers’ responses demonstrated various observable differences in average sustainability scores. Social desirability bias and supplier assessment fatigue were identified as issues confronting such questionnaires. We find that questionnaire design, how the questionnaire is embedded in the focal company’s processes and institutional settings are factors that potentially influence suppliers’ responses and could counteract social desirability bias and supplier assessment fatigue. Based on these findings we make suggestions for improving these SSCM tools and provide recommendations for further research.","Two decades ago, Crane  titled an article “Are you ethical? Please tick yes or no.” Over 20 years later, the title is relevant to sustainable supply chain management (SSCM) research and warrants specific academic attention. Global buying companies increasingly monitor and/or evaluate the sustainability practises of their suppliers with the help of self-assessment questionnaires but these central tools have not been featured in SSCM investigations. This is a problem because, as Das  argues the challenge for SSCM as an academic discipline is “how to make the broad concepts of sustainability relevant, applicable and operationalisable to SCM at firm level” (Das 2017, p. 1345). The problem is, how sure are we about the accuracy of such tools for conveying suppliers’ sustainability practices and performance? And how can companies trust the responses and data generated? The last decade has seen a veritable boom in publications focussing on SSCM, the closely-related areas of responsible/green/sustainable purchasing and supplier management (Ahi and Searcy 2013; Ansari and Kant 2017; Beske-Janssen et al. 2015; Brandenburg et al. 2019; Gimenez and Tachizawa 2012; de Oliveira et al. 2018; Seuring and Müller 2008; Koberg and Longoni 2019; Walker et al. 2012). This intensification of research corresponds with a continual increase in the importance of SSCM to practitioners/companies, as evidenced by the growth in activity within and among firms regarding sustainability in supply chains (Gimenez and Tachizawa 2012; Schoeggl et al. 2016a; Sancha et al. 2016; Singh and Trivedi 2016). At the same time we note an intensification of stakeholder expectations (Seuring and Müller 2008; Li et al. 2014; Mueller and Bessas 2017) and a densification of guiding frameworks (Rasche and Gilbert 2012; Seuring and Gold 2013; Lee and Kashmanian 2013). By now, large multi-national corporations will inevitably include their approaches to supply chain sustainability in their sustainability reporting (Harms et al. 2011; Walker and Jones 2012). Nonetheless, there still appears to be a gap between theoretical academic SSCM research on the one hand, and SSCM practice on the other. Companies confront increasing expectations of their responsibility and have to devise strategies, measures, processes and tools to improve sustainability in their supply networks as part of their broader sustainability strategies (Canzaniello et al. 2017; Ecovadis 2017; Pagell and Shevchenko 2014)."

This paper studies the technical feasibility of user-specific face mask production by 3D printing and the effectiveness of these masks. Material & methods Six different face mask designs were produced by 3D printing and tested by subjective experimenter evaluation and using a respirator fit testing kit. Results were compared with the requirements as given for standard protective face masks. Results None of the printed masks came anywhere near the required standards for personal protective gear. Conclusion In spite of their euphoric presentation in the press, none of the currently advertised 3D printed mask designs are suitable as reliable personal protective equipment.","In order to simulate a typical chain of development, production and supply, the medical members of the research group, in other words, the working group ‘3D Printing in Neurosurgery’ were assigned the role of ‘users’. Since it is an adaptive design, product development according to VDI 2221 (Association of German Engineers) begins as early as the design phase. To ensure that this phase can be completed as effectively and quickly as possible, the evaluation of the designs is carried out directly at the user’s premises by the user. The direct user feedback enables a target-oriented development according to the needs of the user. For this purpose, desktop 3D printers, such as Ultimaker 3 (Ultimaker, Geldermalsen, The Netherlands), were installed at the user’s premises at the Neurosurgical Department of the German Armed Forces Hospital in Westerstede. Mask designs were developed and constructed at the Laboratory for Manufacturing Technologies of the University of the German Armed Forces in Hamburg by using the design software Fusion 360 (Autodesk, WA DC, USA). The designs were then digitally transferred to the user environment for prototype production and evaluation (Figure 1). By directly involving the user in the product development process, the time to the finished product can be minimized. Even if designer, constructor and user are not at the same place, a fast iteration to the final product can be carried out by the digital transmission of the model data and the production at the users site. The feedback about possible design changes is then again carried out via a digital medium and can be immediately implemented in a new version/draft. This process enables the development department to respond directly to new user requirements and test them. Product errors can be detected and corrected at an early stage through the extensive use of prototypes in final product quality. The open-source Standard Triangulation Language (STL-data) of four different face masks (Copper 3D NanoHack, www.copper3d.com; Lafactoria3D corona virus disease (COVID-19) Mask V2, www.lafactoria3d.es; Maker Mask Respirator, www.makermask.com; Montana Mask, www.longliveyoursmile.com) were downloaded from the internet. The foldable Copper 3D NanoHack mask was further developed and adapted to the requirements of the physicians represented in the working group using the previously described design process. This led to the production of two modified face mask (FM) versions, the HSU/BwKWST FM V3 (V3) and HSU/BwKWST FM V4 (V4). The COVID-19 Mask V2 was available in different sizes. For comparison, printing of the large mask with thick wall diameter, which was provided in the downloadable file, was chosen."

The birth–death serial model (BDSIR) package of BEAST2 was used to calculate the reproduction number of SARS-CoV-2. Population dynamics were investigated using the stamp date method as implemented in BEAST2 and BEAST 1.10.4. Results A median-joining network revealed two ancestral clusters. A high basic reproduction number of SARS-CoV-2 was found. An exponential rise in the effective population size of Indian isolates was detected. Conclusion The phylogenetic network reveals dual ancestry and possibility of community transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in India.","Whole-genome sequence information on SARS-CoV-2 isolates from India, available in the GISAID database until 4 May 2020, was retrieved. Out of 286 SARS-CoV-2 genomes, samples with missing information and gaps were discarded to arrive at a total of 219 Indian SARS-CoV-2 genomes. These genomes were aligned using Clustal Omega  and the number of haplotypes was determined using DnaSP v6 . Based on the emergence of 138 haplotypes, the resulting dataset was further used for downstream analyses. In evolutionary studies, phylogenetic networking is becoming a method of choice for reconstructing evolutionary pathways in many species. The Median-Joining Network (MJN) is one such algorithm developed to reconstruct the unambiguous evolutionary history of species . An MJN was constructed with 138 genomes covering all major states of India (Supplementary Table 1). The birth–death serial model (BDSIR), as implemented in the BEAST2 package, was used to estimate the effective R0 of SARS-CoV-2 in India [26, 27]. In BEAST2, an HKY nucleotide substitution model with a gamma category count of 4, a relaxed lognormal clock with a clock rate of 8.3E-5 subs/site/month corresponding to 1 × 10-3 subs/site/year  were applied. In Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) analysis, parameters were sampled every 1000 generations over a total of 10 million generations. The basic R0 and BecomeUinfectiousRate were set with the mean distribution to 18.00, assuming a mean recovery time between 18 and 20 days. BEAST v1.10.4, with similar settings to those of the HKY nucleotide substitution model with a gamma category count of 4, a relaxed lognormal clock, and a clock rate of 8.3E-5 subs/site/month corresponding to 1 × 10-3 subs/site/year  was utilized to reconstruct the evolutionary dynamics of SARS-CoV-2. The tree prior was set to the coalescent exponential growth to calculate the growth rates of the virus in India. The effective sample sizes and 95% highest posterior density intervals for parameters like the basic R0, BecomeUinfectiousRate, growth rate and the demographic reconstruction of growth rates with exponential growth priors were inspected using Tracer v1.7.0. The trees file was summarized in TreeAnnotator by setting the burnin percentage to ten and the target tree type to maximum clade creditability tree, while the node heights were set to mean heights. The time-scaled Maximum Clade Credibility tree based on MCMC analysis of the 138 SARS-CoV-2 genomes was visualized in the FigTree v1.4.4 tree viewer. The Bayesian Skyline Plot (BSP) method as implemented in BEAST v2.2.0 was used to estimate the effective population size (Ne) for these 138 Indian isolates (Supplementary Table 2). The stamped-date method with HKY nucleotide substitution as a model coupled with 4 gamma category and coalescent Bayesian skyline tree priors were set for the analysis. The MCMC chain length of 10 million steps was applied, the first 10% were discarded as burn-in, and a strict clock rate of 8.33E-5 subs/per/site/per month was used. The log file and tree log file were analyzed to draw the BSP in Tracer v1.7.0. The MJN showed the occurrence of ancestral clusters alongside their newly mutated daughter clusters and haplotypes. The network was defined by two main clusters marked as ‘A’ and ‘B’ (Figure 1). Both A and B clusters showed linkage with the Wuhan, China outbreak haplotype (EPI_ISL_406798) of 26 December 2019. Cluster A, which was dominant in Gujarat, differed by a single median vector from the Wuhan haplotype as compared with cluster B, dominant in south India, which differed by two median vectors. In a biological network, median vectors are interpreted either as unsampled or extinct individuals. Based on this relationship, cluster A was considered as the ancestral node. Genomes of unknown origin contributed by National Institute of Virology, Pune showed greater affinity with SARS-CoV-2 genomes from Wuhan and Ladakh and were linked to ancestral cluster A. However, genome isolates from West Bengal illustrated affinities with both clusters. Of note, haplotypes from the worst hit Maharashtra state, including Mumbai, exhibited closer relatedness to cluster B. Further, the SARS-CoV-2 haplotypes from Delhi were more widespread in distribution, while those from Madhya Pradesh displayed closer relatedness to ancestral cluster A. Many daughter haplotypes accumulated 1–4 mutations that were derived from clusters A and B. In one instance in the network, a daughter cluster derived from cluster B illustrated sharing of haplotypes from Delhi, Telangana and Assam and can potentially be considered as a third minor subcluster. This subcluster further showed the emergence of newer haplotypes by accumulating mutations in the range of 2–3 with the sole representative from Gujarat. Based on this median joining network, autochthonous and community transmission of the virus in India cannot be ruled out. Similarly, the Time-Scaled Maximum Clade Credibility tree based on MCMC analysis with an Exponential Growth tree prior reveals the basal position of the haplotype from Kerala (Figure 2). The tree shows the splitting of haplotypes into two major clades, i.e., Telangana and Gujarat, whereas the samples contributed by the National Institute of Virology, Pune, Maharashtra displayed monophyletic status with the isolates from Telangana (Figure 2). The effective R0 of SARS-CoV-2 in India was found to be 3.683 (95% highest posterior density [HPD] interval 2.411, 5.401). The estimated mean infectious rate, which is the actual time needed for recovery after the infection, was estimated as 7.44 (95% HPD interval 4.51, 9.99), which roughly corresponds to approximately 40–50 days. The current population dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 in India from the last week of January (27 January 2020) to the first week of May (4 May 2020) was plotted using a BSP. The population dynamics of Indian isolates exhibited a sigmoidal type of distribution, with exponential growth of the Ne starting from the last week of January to the second week of February (Figure 3A). The pandemic peaked in India around the second week of February and plateaued between the last week of February and 4 May 2020. However, growth rate curve reconstruction using an exponential growth tree prior depicted a continuous increase in the effective population from the last week of January–4 May 2020 (Figure 3B)."
PMC7723464,2020-12-09,Contributory role of SARS-CoV-2 genomic variations and life expectancy in COVID-19 transmission and low fatality rate in Africa," The novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has claimed lots of lives, posing a dire threat to global health. It was predicted that the coronavirus outbreak in the African population would be very lethal and result to economic devastation owing to the prevalence of immune-compromised population, poverty, low lifespan, fragile health care systems, poor economy, and lifestyle factors. Accumulation of mutations gives virus selective advantage for host invasion and adaptation, higher transmissibility of more virulent strains, and drug resistance. The present study determined the severe acute respiratory syndrome-2 (SARS-CoV-2) genomic variability and the contributory factors to the low COVID-19 fatality in Africa. To assess the SARS-CoV-2 mutational landscape, 924 viral sequences from the Africa region with their sociobiological characteristics mined from the Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data (GISAID) database were analyzed. RESULTS Mutational analysis of the SARS-CoV-2 sequences revealed highly recurrent mutations in the SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein D614G (97.2%), concurrent R203K, and G204R (65.2%) in the nucleocapsid phosphoprotein, and P4715L (97.2%) in the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase flagging these regions as SARS-CoV-2 mutational hotspots in the African population. COVID-19 is more severe in older people (> 65 years); Africa has a low percentage of people within this age group (4.36%). The average age of the infected patients observed in this study is 46 years with only 47 infected patients (5.1%) above 65 years in Africa in comparison to 13.12% in countries in other continents with the highest prevalence of COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS Africa’s young generation, the late incidence of the disease, and adherence to public health guidelines are important indicators that may have contributed to the observed low COVID-19 deaths in Africa. However, with the easing of lockdown and regulatory policies, daily increasing incidence in most countries, and low testing and sequencing rate, the epidemiology and the true impact of the pandemic in Africa remain to be unraveled.","Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the causative pathogen of the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), was first reported in December 2019 in Wuhan, China [1, 2]. The highly infectious SARS-CoV-2 has spread globally within 3-months of its first outbreak and has posed dire stress on public health and global economy [1, 3]. Globally, as of October 16, 2020, there have been 39,153,270 confirmed cases and 1,102,440 reported deaths due to COVID-19 . It was predicted that the coronavirus outbreak in the African population would be very lethal and result to economic devastation owing to the prevalence of immune-compromised population (due to HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, hepatitis virus, malaria, etc.), poverty, low lifespan, fragile health care systems, poor economic decisions, and lifestyle factors [3, 5]. Africa was the last continent to be hit, and surprisingly boast of about 80% recovery rate at this stage of the pandemic . Africa accounts for 3.5% of the fatality rate recorded globally with the highest death toll reported in Americas (55.1%) and Europe (25.7%) which are developed regions with high standard of living and healthcare structure [6, 7]. In line with public health and the World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines, the African governments and policy makers were quick to institute policies (restrictions such as partial/full-scale lockdowns, physical distancing, accelerated contact tracing, self-isolation, and quarantine) and adopt public health measures in light of the index case in the continent [7–9]. Africa’s index case of COVID-19 was on the 14th of February, 2020, in Egypt, North Africa  and on the 27th of February, Nigeria; Sub-Saharan Africa reported its index case from a European traveler . As of October 16, 2020, there have been 1,623,181 confirmed cases and 39,150 deaths in Africa, out of which South Africa has the highest toll with 698,184 confirmed cases and 18,309 deaths . Coronaviruses are single-positive-stranded RNA viruses with the largest genome (ranging from 26 to 32 kb) among all RNA viruses consisting of ORF1ab (21,289 nucleotides), ORF3a (827 nucleotides), ORF3b (455 nucleotides), ORF6 (185 nucleotides), ORF7a (365 nucleotides), ORF7b (131 nucleotides), ORF8 (365 nucleotides), ORF10 (116 nucleotides), and four genes encoding structural proteins the nucleocapsid (1259 nucleotides), membrane (668 nucleotides), envelope (227 nucleotides), and spike (3,821 nucleotides) [1, 12–14]. Accumulation of mutation is central to viral evolution, transmission, and virulence. This gives virus selective advantage for host invasion and adaptation, higher transmissibility of more virulent strains, and drug resistance [9, 14, 15]. Identifying the mutational pattern of coronaviruses and monitoring their spread can be important in guiding drug/vaccine development and in making decisions to curtail the transmission . The present study aims to gain insight into the mutational landscape of the SARS-CoV-2 genome in African population which may serve as eventual targets for drug design and/or vaccine development. This study also assesses the contributory factors to the low fatality rate due to COVID-19 in the African continent."
PMC7737909,2020-12-15,The role of tropospheric ozone in flagging COVID-19 pandemic transmission,"COVID-19 pandemic outbreak, caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, affected millions of people worldwide causing hundreds of thousands of related fatalities. It is crucial to understand why the virus transmission seems to spread more easily in some regions than others. The residuals, with respect to the modeled COVID-19 per-day hospitalized patients in intensive care unit, are correlated to the meteorological and air-pollutant variables in four major metropolitan areas in Italy during a strict lockdown implemented by the Italian government, making the analysis independent from socio-economic factors. The results show that COVID-19 pandemic–related infections are slowed down by higher tropospheric ozone concentrations and eased by the atmospheric particulate. We quantitatively assessed that higher levels of tropospheric ozone, already proven effective against viruses and microbial contaminants, play a role in flagging COVID-19 pandemic transmission. Because the tropospheric ozone production is depending, among others, by air-quality and sunlight, this can explain why the virus is spreading in different ways.","In Fig. 1, we show the model, and the per-day number of ICU hospitalized patients for Milan, Trento, Florence, and Rome and the corresponding residuals. The correlations between COVID-19 pandemic and meteorological and air pollution variables were investigated using non-linear Spearman and Kendall rank correlation tests.

PMC7744256,2020-12-17,Mapping the cryptic spread of the 2015–2016 global Zika virus epidemic," Zika virus (ZIKV) emerged as a global epidemic in 2015–2016 from Latin America with its true geographical extent remaining unclear due to widely presumed underreporting. The identification of locations with potential and unknown spread of ZIKV is a key yet understudied component for outbreak preparedness. Here, we aim to identify locations at a high risk of cryptic ZIKV spread during 2015–2016 to further the understanding of the global ZIKV epidemiology, which is critical for the mitigation of the risk of future epidemics. METHODS We developed an importation simulation model to estimate the weekly number of ZIKV infections imported in each susceptible spatial unit (i.e. location that did not report any autochthonous Zika cases during 2015–2016), integrating epidemiological, demographic, and travel data as model inputs. Thereafter, a global risk model was applied to estimate the weekly ZIKV transmissibility during 2015–2016 for each location. Finally, we assessed the risk of onward ZIKV spread following importation in each susceptible spatial unit to identify locations with a high potential for cryptic ZIKV spread during 2015–2016. RESULTS We have found 24 susceptible spatial units that were likely to have experienced cryptic ZIKV spread during 2015–2016, of which 10 continue to have a high risk estimate within a highly conservative scenario, namely, Luanda in Angola, Banten in Indonesia, Maharashtra in India, Lagos in Nigeria, Taiwan and Guangdong in China, Dakar in Senegal, Maputo in Mozambique, Kinshasa in Congo DRC, and Pool in Congo. Notably, among the 24 susceptible spatial units identified, some have reported their first ZIKV outbreaks since 2017, thus adding to the credibility of our results (derived using 2015–2016 data only). CONCLUSION Our study has provided valuable insights into the potentially high-risk locations for cryptic ZIKV circulation during the 2015–2016 pandemic and has also laid a foundation for future studies that attempt to further narrow this key knowledge gap. Our modelling framework can be adapted to identify areas with likely unknown spread of other emerging vector-borne diseases, which has important implications for public health readiness especially in resource-limited settings.","Zika virus (ZIKV) is a flavivirus that is mainly transmitted by the Aedes mosquitoes . Since its first isolation in a Ugandan forest in 1947 , the virus has until recent years only caused regional outbreaks [3, 4]. In February 2016, a Public Health Emergency of International Concern was declared by the World Health Organization, as ZIKV swept through the majority of the countries in Latin America and the Caribbean, coinciding with an unusual increase in the number of microcephaly cases and other neurological disorders . The reported ZIKV incidence declined substantially after 2016 , but in the meantime, new scientific evidence continued to emerge and reveal new locations where ZIKV circulation had never been identified before . More recently, the first autochthonous ZIKV case in Europe was reported in October 2019 with its source remaining unknown at the time of writing , which underscores our limited understanding of the virus's epidemiology. Although ZIKV is no longer a public health emergency, the potential reoccurrence of future large-scale epidemics remains a concern, which necessitates continued investments in ZIKV research and surveillance in preparation for such an event . To date, modelling studies have yielded important insights into the virus's transmission dynamics [10–14], ecological niche [15–17], and at-risk population size , but little has been done to understand the gap between where cases may have already occurred and where they have been reported . Due to the high proportion of ZIKV infections that are asymptomatic and its similarity in clinical presentation to other diseases such as dengue fever , undetected or unreported spread of ZIKV was widely presumed, especially in countries with limited public health resources . The identification of these locations is critical, as their healthcare systems may be overwhelmed during possible future waves of epidemics if ill prepared, and due to the risk of onward dissemination via air travel. Whilst a recent study used travel surveillance and viral genomes data to detect an unreported ZIKV outbreak in Cuba , our understanding of the geographical areas that are likely to have experienced cryptic ZIKV spread is still seriously lacking at a global scale. To narrow this knowledge gap requires a novel modelling framework integrating a wide range of factors that determine the worldwide introduction of the virus and the subsequent autochthonous transmission."
PMC7750914,2020-12-21,Assessment of the potential role of atmospheric particulate pollution and airborne transmission in intensifying the first wave pandemic impact of SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19 in Northern Italy,"The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which exploded in Wuhan (Hebei Region, China) in late 2019, has later spread around the world, causing pandemic effects on humans. During the first wave of the pandemic, Italy, and especially its Northern regions around the Po Valley, faced severe consequences in terms of infected individuals and casualties (more than 31,000 deaths and 255,000 infected people by mid-May 2020). While the spread and effective impact of the virus is primarily related to the lifestyles and social habits of the different human communities, environmental and meteorological factors also play a role. Among these, particulate pollution may directly impact the human respiratory system or act as virus carrier, thus behaving as potential amplifying factor in the pandemic spread of SARS-CoV-2. Enhanced levels of PM(2.5) and PM particles in Northern Italy were observed over the 2-month period preceding the virus pandemic spread. Threshold levels for PM (< 50 μg/m) were exceeded on 20–35 days over the period January–February 2020 in many areas in the Po Valley, where major effects in terms of infections and casualties occurred, with levels in excess of 80 μg/m occasionally observed in the 1–3 weeks preceding the contagious activation around February 25, 2020. Threshold values for PM(2.5) indicated in WHO air quality guidelines (< 25 μg/m) were exceeded on more than 40 days over the period January–February 2020 in large portions of the Po Valley, with levels up to 70 μg/m observed in the weeks preceding the contagious activation. In this paper, PM particle measurements are compared with epidemiologic parameters’ data. Specifically, a statistical analysis is carried out to correlate the infection rate, or incidence of the pathology, the mortality rate, and the case fatality rate with PM concentrations. The study considers epidemiologic data for all 110 Italian provinces, as reported by the Italian Statistics Institute, over the period 20 February–31 March 2020. Corresponding PM concentrations covering the period 15–26 February 2020 were collected from the network of air quality monitoring stations run by different regional and provincial environment agencies. The case fatality rate is found to be highly correlated to the average PM concentration, with a correlation coefficient of 0.89 and a slope of the regression line of (6.7 ± 0.3) × 10(−3) m/μg, which implies a doubling (from 3 to 6%) of the mortality rate of infected patients for an average PM concentration increase from 22 to 27 μg/m. Infection and mortality rates are also found to be correlated with PM concentrations, with correlation coefficients being 0.82 and 0.80, respectively, and the slopes of the regression lines indicating a doubling (from 1 to 2‰) of the infection rate and a tripling (from 0.1 to 0.3‰) of the mortality rate for an average PM concentration increase from 25 to 29 μg/m. Considerations on the exhaled particles’ sizes, their concentrations and residence times, the transported viral dose and the minimum infective dose, in combination with PM(2.5) and PM pollution measurements and an analytical microphysical model, allowed assessing the potential role of airborne transmission through virus-laden PM particles, in addition to droplet and the traditional airborne transmission, in conveying SARS-CoV-2 in the human respiratory system. In specific circumstances which can be found in indoor environments, the number of small potentially infectious particles coalescing on PM(2.5) and PM particles is estimated to exceed the number of infectious particles needed to activate COVID-19 infection in humans.","PM2.5 and PM10 are particles with an aerodynamic diameter smaller than 2.5 and 10 μm, respectively, which are often present in the air. These small particles can be either organic or inorganic and can be present in both solid and liquid phase. They are capable of adsorbing on their surface various substances with toxic properties such as sulfates, nitrates, metals, and volatile compounds (Park et al. 2018). Suspended PM2.5 and PM10 particles have a significant impact on human health, the higher being their concentration, the greater being their health impact (Dockery et al. 1993; Pope et al. 1995; Brunekreef 1997; Hoek et al. 2002). More specifically, atmospheric aerosols play an important role in triggering pro-inflammation and oxidation mechanisms of the lungs. Prolonged exposure to PM2.5 and PM10 particles has been found to be linked to acute respiratory inflammation and immunological alterations (Li et al. 2018; Losacco and Perillo 2018). Aerosols can represent an important vehicle for virus transmission (Sattar and Ijaz 1987; Fabian et al. 2008; Tellier 2009)."
PMC7796457,2021-01-05,Epidemiological Analysis of the 2019 Dengue Epidemic in Bhutan,"Bhutan experienced its largest and first nation-wide dengue epidemic in 2019. The cases in 2019 were greater than the total number of cases in all the previous years. This study aimed to characterize the spatiotemporal patterns and effective reproduction number of this explosive epidemic. Weekly notified dengue cases were extracted from the National Early Warning, Alert, Response and Surveillance (NEWARS) database to describe the spatial and temporal patterns of the epidemic. The time-varying, temperature-adjusted cohort effective reproduction number was estimated over the course of the epidemic. The dengue epidemic occurred between 29 April and 8 December 2019 over 32 weeks, and included 5935 cases. During the epidemic, dengue expanded from six to 44 subdistricts. The effective reproduction number was <3 for most of the epidemic period, except for a ≈1 month period of explosive growth, coinciding with the monsoon season and school vacations, when the effective reproduction number peaked >30 and after which the effective reproduction number declined steadily. Interventions were only initiated 6 weeks after the end of the period of explosive growth. This finding highlights the need to reinforce the national preparedness plan for outbreak response, and to enable the early detection of cases and timely response.","Dengue is an emerging vector-borne disease with a rapidly expanding global distribution and an increasing intensity of transmission in affected regions . Globally, an estimated 390 million dengue infections occur each year and nearly 4 billion people are at risk of the disease [2,3]. A global dengue pandemic began in South-East Asia and the Pacific region during and after World War II . The movement of troops during World War II, along with the destruction of the environment and human settlement has substantially contributed to the spread of dengue viruses and their vectors in these regions . Climate change, economic booms (with uncontrolled urbanization and development), and unprecedented human travel have contributed to further spread of the dengue epidemic, which continues to encroach on new geographical locations [5,6,7]. Before the 1970s, only nine countries experienced severe dengue epidemics . However, dengue is now endemic in over 140 countries in Africa, the Americas, the Eastern Mediterranean, and Asia . In the South-East Asia Region, severe dengue is the leading cause of hospitalization and death among children . For these reasons, the World Health Organization (WHO) has included dengue in the potential public health emergency of international concern (PHEIC) list under the current International Health Regulations (IHR) . Dengue is caused by arthropod-borne flaviviruses belonging to one or more of the four known dengue virus serotypyes (DENV1-4) . The virus is transmitted through the bites of an infective female Aedes mosquitoes, mainly Aedes aegypti, and to a lesser extent, Aedes albopictus. Both species feed during the daytime from morning until dusk, although night-time biting is also reported in the case of Ae. albopictus . Ae. aegypti breeds both indoors and outdoors, while Ae. albopictus is well-adapted to the peridomestic environment and typically breeds outdoors ."

There is still no effective and approved antiretroviral treatment or vaccine, so preventative measures remain the key to contain this pandemic. Portugal is now in phase 3.2 of the mitigation of COVID-19, with it being imperative to understand the health literacy of our country and prevent a lack of information through community empowerment. MATERIAL AND METHODS A cross-sectional study with a sample from a primary care facility was conducted. We collected demographic and epidemiological data and carried out a questionnaire by phone call. Descriptive statistics and nonparametric tests were used to assess associations between the independent variables and the level of health literacy. The level of significance was set at p < 0.05. RESULTS Our sample included 222 subjects (median age 62 years), mostly females (n = 131), undergraduates (n = 193), and with at least 1 risk factor for COVID-19 (n = 144). Overall, younger individuals, females, graduates and the nonrisk group appeared to have higher levels of health literacy, with some exceptions. CONCLUSIONS We observed a well-informed population. However, it being a pandemic situation, our intention was to identify and correct outliers/misconceptions. This work allowed a perspective of the current state/pattern of health literacy as well as its possible predictors. Furthermore, it raised awareness of the relevance of specific communication approaches. Further studies to understand the predictors of health literacy are necessary.","In December 2019, there was an outbreak of pneumonia with unknown etiology in the city of Wuhan, China, and the diagnosis of influenza and other Coronaviruses (MERS and SARS) were considered but later excluded by laboratory tests [1, 2]. On 7 January 2020, China announced that the cause was a new Coronavirus strain, later designated SARS-CoV-2 and proved to occur in wild bats [2, 3, 4]. The transmission mode of SARS-nCoV-2 is through respiratory droplets, which are either a source of direct or indirect contamination [5, 6]. This virus strain presented a basic reproduction number (R0) within a range of 1.4–6.5, with the highest infection rates in the elderly and people with underlying pathologies [2, 7]. This means that this virus has a high rate of human-to-human transmission and a person is more contagious the more symptomatic they are [6, 8]. The median age of patients with symptoms seems to be around 47–59 years, but it can affect individuals of all ages ."
PMC7819146,2021-01-21,Supergroup F Wolbachia in terrestrial isopods: Horizontal transmission from termites?,"Horizontal transmission between distantly related species has been used to explain how Wolbachia infect multiple species at astonishing rates despite the selection for resistance. Recently, a terrestrial isopod species was found to be infected by an unusual strain of supergroup F Wolbachia. However, only Wolbachia of supergroup B is typically found in isopods. One possibility is that these isopods acquired the infection because of their recurrent contact with termites—a group with strong evidence of infection by supergroup F Wolbachia. Thus, our goals were  check if the infection was an isolated case in isopods, or if it revealed a broader pattern;  search for Wolbachia infection in the termites within Brazil; and  look for evidence consistent with horizontal transmission between isopods and termites. We collected Neotroponiscus terrestrial isopods and termites along the Brazilian coastal Atlantic forest. We sequenced and identified the Wolbachia strains found in these groups using coxA, dnaA, and fpbA genes. We constructed phylogenies for both bacteria and host taxa and tested for coevolution. We found the supergroup F Wolbachia in other species and populations of Neotroponiscus, and also in Nasutitermes and Procornitermes termites. The phylogenies showed that, despite the phylogenetic distance between isopods and termites, the Wolbachia strains clustered together. Furthermore, cophylogenetic analyses showed significant jumps of Wolbachia between terrestrial isopods and termites. Thus, our study suggests that the horizontal transmission of supergroup F Wolbachia between termites and terrestrial isopods is likely. Our study also helps understanding the success and worldwide distribution of this symbiont.

This evolutionary success that elevated Wolbachia to pandemic status was made possible by the efficient vertical transmission and the reproductive manipulation of hosts (Gerth et al. 2014). Despite the seeming success, several host lineages show a ‘loss’ of Wolbachia infection probably due to a selection for resistance (Zug and Hammerstein 2012). In fact, according to estimates, 0.14 loss events and 0.11 acquisition events are expected per million years (Bailly-Bechet et al. 2017). Nevertheless, Wolbachia maintain their infection prevalence at very high rates, particularly in arthropods, and this does not seem constrained by host phylogenetics (Zug and Hammerstein 2012). One possibility for the high prevalence rates might thus lie in the diversity of Wolbachia bacteria. To assess Wolbachia diversity, researchers used phylogenetic approaches that lead to their classification in ‘supergroups’ (Werren et al. 1995; Bandi et al. 1998; Casiraghi et al. 2005; Baldo et al. 2006b). To some extent, each Wolbachia ‘supergroup’ seems to associate with particular host groups; and the host groups differ among the supergroups. For example, supergroup A and B strains are the most abundant ones, being found in ∼ 40% of all terrestrial arthropods’ species (Zug and Hammerstein 2012). Wolbachia of supergroups C and D are found exclusively in co-evolutionary associations consistent with their mutualistic dependency with some filarial nematodes (Taylor et al. 2013). Supergroup F, on the other hand, can infect both arthropods and filarial hosts (Casiraghi et al. 2005). Thus, supergroup F is relatively atypical because of its ability to infect groups that are not phylogenetically close; hence, understanding what makes supergroup F atypical can allow us to understand the evolution of bacterial infection. The mechanisms proposed to explain the phylogenetic widespread pattern of Wolbachia rely on horizontal transmission between distant species with close interactions. These close interactions approximate distant related species physically, creating an opportunity for horizontal transmission, as can be seen in interactions such as parasitoids and phoretic vectors (Covacin and Barker 2006; Gehrer and Vorburger 2012; Ahmed et al. 2015; Qi et al. 2019), use of common food sources (Sintupachee et al. 2006; Oliver et al. 2010; Stahlhut et al. 2010; Li et al. 2017), and predation and cannibalism (Yun et al. 2011; Le Clec’h et al. 2013; Brown and Lloyd 2015; Faria et al. 2016). As Wolbachia appears to transmit easily through hemolymph or the gut, the simplest route of transmission seems to be contacting the uninfected host through excretions or injuries (Rigaud and Juchault 1995). After entering the new host, Wolbachia can use cell-to-cell transfer to establish both somatic and germline infection (Frydman et al. 2006). Alternatively, Wolbachia could infect new hosts without cell-to-cell transfer. By using the host phagocytic and endocytic machinery, they can be transferred successfully to new hosts (White et al. 2017). Thus, one might expect that host groups infected with supergroup F can be infected by and infect any species in which they are in close contact with."
PMC7838212,2021-01-26,Best influential spreaders identification using network global structural properties,"Influential spreaders are the crucial nodes in a complex network that can act as a controller or a maximizer of a spreading process. For example, we can control the virus propagation in an epidemiological network by controlling the behavior of such influential nodes, and amplify the information propagation in a social network by using them as a maximizer. Many indexing methods have been proposed in the literature to identify the influential spreaders in a network. Nevertheless, we have notice that each individual network holds different connectivity structures that we classify as complete, incomplete, or in-between based on their components and density. These affect the accuracy of existing indexing methods in the identification of the best influential spreaders. Thus, no single indexing strategy is sufficient from all varieties of network connectivity structures. This article proposes a new indexing method Network Global Structure-based Centrality (ngsc) which intelligently combines existing kshell and sum of neighbors’ degree methods with knowledge of the network’s global structural properties, such as the giant component, average degree, and percolation threshold. The experimental results show that our proposed method yields a better spreading performance of the seed spreaders over a large variety of network connectivity structures, and correlates well with ranking based on an SIR model used as ground truth. It also out-performs contemporary techniques and is competitive with more sophisticated approaches that are computationally cost.","A spreading process is a common and natural phenomenon in various fields such as social, biological, chemical, electrical, and many others1. In a complex network, influential spreaders act as maximizers or controllers2 of a spreading process. Thus, an influential spreader is an essential element for a spreading process. For instance, to maximize the information spreading an influential spreader acts as a maximizer3, whereas, as a controller, an influential spreader can control epidemics such as COVID-19 or mitigate fake news in a social system4–7. Many methods have been proposed in literature to identify the influential spreaders. Pei et al.8 have classified those methods into finding individual influencers and finding multiple influencers categories. The finding individual influencers category ranks the individual nodes in a network, while the finding multiple influencers category finds the minimal number of nodes for maximizing the total collective influence. All the centrality approaches, such as, degree centrality9, kshell decomposition method10,11, k-truss decomposition method12, closeness centrality13 , betweenness centrality14, eigenvector centrality15, pagerank centrality16, expected force method17, hybridrank18, and improved gravitational method19 come under the first category. On the other hand, optimal percolation method20–22, voterank23, linear threshold model (LTM)24, and independent cascade model (ICM)25 are a few popular methods that belong to the second category. The first category identifies the spreading initiator and controller of a dissemination process26–35, and the initiator nodeset is used as an influence maximizer of a spreading process. The second category identifies the spreading initiators (i.e., minimal nodes) of a dissemination process. We believe that the centrality approaches, which fall in the first category, are more reliable to measure the spreading capability of the nodes. Using these approaches, we can determine each node’s spreading capability, based on which we can maximize or control a spreading process from any topological position. We, therefore, study the centrality method in detail for efficient identification of influential spreaders as an influence maximizer.

PMC7862050,2021-02-05,Analysis of time delayed Rabies model in human and dog populations with controls,"Rabies is a fatal zoonotic disease caused by a virus through bites or saliva of an infected animal. Dogs are the main reservoir of rabies and responsible for most cases in humans worldwide. In this article, a delay differential equations model for assessing the effects of controls and time delay as incubation period on the transmission dynamics of rabies in human and dog populations is formulated and analyzed. Analysis from the model show that there is a locally and globally asymptotic stable disease-free equilibrium whenever a certain epidemiological threshold, the control reproduction number [Formula see text] , is less than unity. Furthermore, the model has a unique endemic equilibrium when [Formula see text] exceed unity which is also locally and globally asymptotically stable for all delays. Time delay is found to have influence on the endemicity of rabies. Vaccination of humans and dogs coupled with annual crop of puppies are imposed to curtail the spread of rabies in the populations. Sensitivity analysis on the number of infected humans and dogs revealed that increasing dog vaccination rate and decreasing annual birth of puppies are more effective in human populations. However in dog populations, the vaccination and birth control of puppies, have equal effective measures for rabies control. Numerical experiments are conducted to illustrate the theoretical results and control strategies.","Rabies is an acute and fatal zoonotic virus disease mainly affecting all species of mammals and other carnivores with dogs being the carrier for most human cases worldwide [6, 28, 32]. The rabies virus is mainly contained in the saliva of animals but may also be found in tears, urine, semen and other body fluids [2, 8]. The virus infects central nervous system and causes cerebral dysfunction in the brain, and once clinical symptoms developed, its mortality rate is certain [15, 34].

Dogs are the primary sources of rabies in humans, and the main transmission route is through bites or scratch, especially by infected dogs [5, 18, 34]. Rabies can also be transmitted through direct contact with wound or mucosal surface (e.g. mouth, nose, eye) that is contaminated with the saliva from a rabid dog . Humans and other mammals can develop rabies from aerosol transmission or through transplantation of tissues and organs [2, 30]. At the early stage of infection, initial symptoms of rabies resemble flu-like which include fever with pain and unusual or unexplained tingling, hypersalivation, sore throat, cough, nausea and vomiting, pricking, or burning sensation (paraesthesia) at the site of animal bite [28, 32]. Thereafter, as the virus spreads to the central nervous system, progressive and fatal inflammation of the brain and spinal cord developed resulting in hyperactivity and paralysis ."
PMC7889414,2021-02-18,Spatial modeling of COVID-19 transmission in Bangladesh,"The purpose of the research was to investigate and identify the demographic risk factors behind the transmission of COVID-19 in Bangladesh based on spatial and statistical modeling. Number of COVID-19 confirmed cases per thousand population as the dependent variable and nine demographic explanatory variables were considered. Different spatial (i.e., Spatial Lag and Spatial Error Model) and non-spatial (Classic Model) regression techniques were employed in the research to detect the geographical relevance of potential risk factors affecting the transmission of COVID-19. Results indicate that population density was crucial for explaining the pattern of COVID-19 transmission in Bangladesh. Spatial Auto-correlation suggests that the spatial pattern of population density were significantly clustered at a confidence interval of 95%. Again, the regression analysis also shows that population density is an influential determinant for the propagation of COVID-19 in Bangladesh, with densely populated districts like Dhaka and Narayanganj also being among the worst affected areas. The findings of this research will help the government agencies and communities for effective and well-informed decision making in order to develop and implement strategies to contain the further spread of COVID-19 in Bangladesh.","Novel coronavirus (COVID-19) is rapidly infecting people around the globe . As of June 11, 2020, 7,273,958 people were infected and 413,372 died throughout the world . COVID-19 has first emerged in Wuhan (Hubei, China) in December 2019 [3, 4], and rapidly spread in the European countries in early 2020 . The World Health Organization (WHO) declared the epidemic as a Public Health Emergency of international concern on 30 January 2020  and as a pandemic on 12 March 2020 . In recent times, like in the European countries, COVID-19 is spreading rapidly in the South-East Asian countries (i.e., India, Bangladesh, and Indonesia, etc.) with 407,414 confirmed cases as of 11 June 2020 . The World Health Organization (WHO) confirmed community transmission of COVID-19 in two countries of this region (on 1 June 2020 in Bangladesh  and on 13 April 2020 in Indonesia ). Community transmission of such an infectious disease (i.e., COVID-19) in a densely populated country like Bangladesh might be severe for every citizen. Bangladesh is already one of the world’s most vulnerable country to climate change induced natural disasters [9, 10]. In terms of the risk of transmission of COVID-19, Haider et al.  have classified Bangladesh into the 4th quantile (highest risk) based on the destinations of the passengers travelling from four major cities of China from January onwards. The first COVID-19 patient was confirmed on 8 March 2020  and total confirmed cases were 74,865 as of 11 June 2020. In early March 2020, immigrants (mostly from China, Italy, USA, UK, etc.) returned to Bangladesh, allegedly carrying the coronavirus and eventually infecting more people. The unwillingness of immigrants with regards to following quarantine and social distancing rules could be one of the major causes of community transmission of COVID-19 . The prevailing demographic (i.e., high population density) and socio-economic (i.e., extreme poverty) structure of the country meant that lockdown measures imposed by the government was not effective enough in containing the spread of COVID-19 countrywide . The government of Bangladesh has taken several measures including the declaration of public holidays, nation-wide lockdown and massive awareness-raising campaigns, but with an increasing number of people being affected and a rising death toll, the overall COVID-19 scenario has shown little signs of improvement till date. It is not obvious which factors are actually aggravating the transmission of COVID-19 in Bangladesh as the causal factors for its spread have not yet been clearly identified."
PMC7910804,2021-02-27,Measles dynamics on network models with optimal control strategies,"To investigate the influences of heterogeneity and waning immunity on measles transmission, we formulate a network model with periodic transmission rate, and theoretically examine the threshold dynamics. We numerically find that the waning of immunity can lead to an increase in the basic reproduction number [Formula see text] and the density of infected individuals. Moreover, there exists a critical level for average degree above which [Formula see text] increases quicker in the scale-free network than in the random network. To design the effective control strategies for the subpopulations with different activities, we examine the optimal control problem of the heterogeneous model. Numerical studies suggest us no matter what the network is, we should implement control measures as soon as possible once the outbreak takes off, and particularly, the subpopulation with high connectivity should require high intensity of interventions. However, with delayed initiation of controls, relatively strong control measures should be given to groups with medium degrees. Furthermore, the allocation of costs (or resources) should coincide with their contact patterns.","Measles, spread by coughing and sneezing, is one of the leading infectious diseases that causes death of children around the world. Vaccination is the key public health strategy to prevent it outbreaks. In 1986, China began to implement two doses of routine vaccination, at 8 months and 7 years old of age .

Hence, how to design an effective strategy to eliminate the measles is still a challenge in mainland China. Measles, like many other infectious diseases, exhibits great heterogeneity in terms of the number and the pattern of contacts. Much research indicated that heterogeneity may lead to highly different transmission dynamics of infectious diseases [3–8]. For example, the basic reproduction number, the threshold value to determine whether disease infection dies out or not, depends crucially on the variance of the distribution of contacts . Accounting for the heterogeneity and non-random mixing, the meta-population basic reproduction numbers were about 70% greater . Compared with the homogeneous mass-action model, the extinction probability of the disease before a large epidemic occurs is much lower for the network model . These results mean that the structure of the contact network is crucial in investigating and characterizing transmission of epidemics. So, many researchers studied the spread of epidemics such as foot-and-mouth disease, SARS, dengue, A/H1N1, and AIDS [12–16] on complex networks and analyzed the threshold of outbreaks and stability of equilibriums [17–21], which can seize the epidemic dynamics and further devise control measures. However, few studies have cautioned on the importance of the contact structures in understanding measles spread. Hence, it is necessary to investigate the network structure and how it relates to the propagation of measles. Moreover, for measles, waning of immunity may be of great risk to induce more infections, since vaccinated individuals with sufficiently low antibody levels are either at risk of disease infection  or have newborn babies with low immunity, who have potential risk to be infected before 8 months. Hence, how the waning of immunity does affect the measles infection also falls within the scope of this study."
PMC7921616,2021-03-02,Effects of Nonmonotonic Functional Responses on a Disease Transmission Model: Modeling and Simulation,"In this article, a novel susceptible–infected–recovered epidemic model with nonmonotonic incidence and treatment rates is proposed and analyzed mathematically. The Monod–Haldane functional response is considered for nonmonotonic behavior of both incidence rate and treatment rate. The model analysis shows that the model has two equilibria which are named as disease-free equilibrium (DFE) and endemic equilibrium (EE). The stability analysis has been performed for the local and global behavior of the DFE and EE. With the help of the basic reproduction number [Formula see text] , we investigate that DFE is locally asymptotically stable when [Formula see text] and unstable when [Formula see text] . The local stability of DFE at [Formula see text] has been analyzed, and it is obtained that DFE exhibits a forward transcritical bifurcation. Further, we identify conditions for the existence of EE and show the local stability of EE under certain conditions. Moreover, the global stability behavior of DFE and EE has been investigated. Lastly, numerical simulations have been done in the support of our theoretical findings.","Mathematical modeling is an effective tool to understand the dynamics of infectious diseases/epidemics from over a century. In mathematical epidemiology, many mathematical models have been proposed for disease transmission dynamics such as SIR [15, 7, 19, 10, 28, 8, 2], SIRS [26, 23], SEIR , and SVEIR  (where S, E, V, I, and R denote the susceptible, exposed, vaccinated, infected, and recovered individuals, respectively). In the disease transmission model, the rate of a new infection mainly depends on the incidence rate. The number of people who become infected per unit of time is defined as the incidence rate . In the pioneering work of Kermack and McKendrick , the incidence rate is in the bilinear form \documentclass[12pt]{minimal}

In M–H incidence function, for a large number of infectious individuals, the infection force may decrease as the number of infectious individuals increases, because in the presence of a large number of infectious individuals the population may tend to reduce the number of contacts per unit time, as seen with the spread of SARS . It is well known that the treatment rate always plays a crucial role in preventing and controlling the spread of infectious diseases. We know that the treatment resources of any community are limited. Therefore, it is essential to choose an effective treatment rate to control the spread of the disease.

In 2013, Dubey et al.  proposed an SEIR model with Holling type III and IV treatment rates for disease dynamics. Motivated by these important works, we have considered the simplified Monod–Haldane (M–H) function type treatment rate in the present epidemic model. In the M–H treatment rate, the treatment rate initially rises with the increase in infectives and achieves the greatest, and after that begins decaying. Such a circumstance may emerge due to the limited availability of treatment for a highly infected population. When the availability of treatment is exhausted (due to the fewer medicines, doctors, and medical staff in hospitals, immunization, etc.), at that point, regardless of the high number of infectives, the accessible medicines turn out to be exceptionally low."

Our model generates predictions consistent with the data unexpected infection resurgence, nonmonotonic mitigation policies, and higher price-to-earnings ratios during a pandemic. Valuations would be significantly lower absent mitigation and a high vaccine arrival rate.","Our paper contributes to several literatures. In epidemiology, aggregate transmission shocks are used in epidemiological forecasting models to capture deviations of infections from deterministic projections (see Dureau et al. 2013 for how parameter perturbation is employed). The analytical treatment of transmission volatility is fully articulated in Gray et al. , who characterize the stationary distribution of our nonlinear diffusion process absent a vaccine. Zhao and Jiang  extend the baseline model setup in Gray et al.  by allowing for a third compartment for the vaccinated. In their paper, a fraction of the population can become vaccinated. They explore stationary distributions in this setting. Given that a goal of our analysis is to analyze the impact of an effective vaccine arrival on both the spread of disease and valuation, we model a vaccine via a Poisson jump process and explore the impact on conditional distributions, particularly how the deterministic model approximations depend on this Poisson arrival rate, and also valuation. Hence, our model contributes to the epidemiology literature by simultaneously accounting for a stochastic vaccine arrival, studying conditional distributions through Kolmogorov equations far from steady state, and deriving the optimal mitigation strategy. Our optimally mitigated stochastic SIS process is new to the epidemiology literature as work on stochastic control in epidemics is limited."
PMC7928662,2021-01-18,"Correlation of the epidemic spread of COVID-19 and urban population migration in the major cities of Hubei Province, China","This study analyses the relationship between the epidemic spread of COVID-19 and urban population migration in Hubei Province, China. Based on an improved gravity model, the population inflow numbers for each city from 10 January to 23 February are estimated. A correlation analysis is done to reveal the impact of population inflow on the number of infected people in the 14 days after 23 January, the day Wuhan was locked down. The results show that (i) the population outflow from Wuhan was mostly distributed between Xiaogan, Huanggang, Ezhou and Huangshi in Hubei Province; (ii) the number of accumulated confirmed patients is closely associated with inflows from Wuhan, which displayed by correlation coefficient 1 with a mean of 0.88 and a maximum of 0.93. Meanwhile, there is a weak correlation between the number of people that came from cities except Wuhan and accumulated confirmed patients, which indicated by correlation coefficient 2 with a mean of 0.65 and a maximum of 0.75; and (iii) the total population inflow is a greater predictor of epidemic spread than the population inflow from Wuhan.","At the end of 2019, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) was first discovered in China and rapidly reported by various overseas regions. As one of the early disaster areas of the COVID-19, Wuhan, is located at the hub of the transportation network, and the outbreak coincided with the Spring Festival travel rush (also known as Chunyun), the annual period of mass migration, large-scale population movement became a booster for the spread of the disease [1, 2]. COVID-19, a new respiratory infection, showed a high correlation with population migration [3, 4], and their relationship is mainly reflected in the incidence of COVID-19 in cities adjacent to Wuhan, Guangzhou, Shenzhen, Shanghai, Changsha and so on, which was significantly higher than the national average. These cities had conducted high-intensity migration movements with Wuhan before the Spring Festival in 2020, according to Baidu migration data. Consequently, it is necessary to conduct research on the mechanism of population migration and epidemic transmission when studying the transmission dynamics and spatial distribution characteristics of COVID-19. The earliest mathematical model of population migration is the classic gravity model. Zipf formally proposed the gravity model based on the research of British demographer Lewinstein . Subsequently, the model was widely applied to the study of population migration [6, 7]. However, due to the major shortcomings of the classic gravity model, such as the loss of characteristics related to individual movement and its poor adaptability to different spatial scales, many scholars began more sophisticated theoretical research after the 1950s."
PMC7931984,2021-03-04,The memory effect on fractional calculus: an application in the spread of COVID-19,"Fractional calculus has been widely used in mathematical modeling of evolutionary systems with memory effect on dynamics. The main interest of this work is to attest, through a statistical approach, how the hysteresis phenomenon, which describes a type of memory effect present in biological systems, can be treated by fractional calculus. We also analyse the contribution of the historical values of a function in the evaluation of fractional operators according to their order. To illustrate the efficiency of this non-integer order calculus, we consider the SIR (susceptible–infected–recovered) compartmental model which is widely used in epidemiology. We employ this compartmental model to study the dynamics of the spread of COVID-19 in some countries, one version with memory and one without memory.","The fractional calculus was originated in 1695 as a generalization of the integer order calculus.

Since its inception, many contributions have been made by several researchers, including famous names such as Euler, Lagrange, Laplace, Fourier, Abel and Liouville (Camargo and Oliveira 2015; Srivastava and Saxena 2001). This calculus is one of the most effective current mathematical tools used to model real-world problems. Several definitions have been proposed for fractional integrals, for example, the fractional integrals of Liouville, Weyl and Riemann–Liouville. The fractional derivative also has several definitions such as those derived from Riemann–Liouville, Caputo, Liouville, Weyl, Riesz, Grünwald–Letnikov, Marchaud and Hifler (Camargo and Oliveira 2015; Saad et al. 2018). In contrast to the Caputo’s fractional derivative, most fractional derivative definitions do not satisfy the property that the derivative of a constant is null. This suggests a preference for the Caputo derivative in many situations. Other definitions that are also commonly used today are of Riemann–Liouville and Grünwald–Letnikov (Camargo and Oliveira 2015; Pinto and Tenreiro Machado 2014)."
PMC7959879,2021-03-16,Crimean-Congo Hemorrhagic Fever Virus (CCHFV): A Silent but Widespread Threat,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW This review is aimed at highlighting recent research and articles on the complicated relationship between virus, vector, and host and how biosurveillance at each level informs disease spread and risk. RECENT FINDINGS While human cases of CCHFV and tick identification in non-endemic areas in 2019–2020 were reported to sites such as ProMed, there is a gap in recent published literature on these and broader CCHFV surveillance efforts from the late 2010s. SUMMARY A review of the complex aspects of CCHFV maintenance in the environment coupled with high fatality rate and lack of vaccines and therapeutics warrants the need for a One-Health approach toward detection and increased biosurveillance programs for CCHFV.","Crimean-Congo Hemorrhagic Fever virus (CCHFV) is a tick-borne pathogen belonging to the Nairoviridae family within the Bunyavirales order . The virus was first discovered in the 1940s when Soviet soldiers became ill with a hemorrhagic disease after occupying Crimea . In the 1960s, a virus with identical clinical manifestations was discovered in the Belgian Congo (now known as the Democratic Republic of Congo) and was determined to be antigenically identical to that of the virus discovered in Crimea, thus giving rise to the name CCHFV . As with all Bunyaviruses, its genome is tripartite consisting of single-stranded (−) RNA segments—annotated based on length as small (S), medium (M), and large (L)—and due to each segment possessing complementary 5′ and 3′ ends, the genome forms iconic circular (panhandle) structures [4, 5]. The segments encode nucleocapsid (N protein), glycoprotein precursor (GPC), and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, respectively . CCHF virions are spherical with a diameter of 80 to 100 nm with an envelope studded with glycoproteins (GPs) Gn and Gc . CCHF is the most widespread tick-borne human disease due to the extensive geographical distribution of its vector, the Hyalomma tick [4, 8]. Distribution of the virus matches that of hard ticks (ixodid) with the genus Hyalomma being the main vector. Transmission to humans occurs through tick bites, tick crushing, and contact with infected blood or tissues. Infection in human can result in mild to severe manifestations with severe cases resulting in hemorrhagic disease and a fatality rate from 5 to 30%. After a short incubation period, commonly a week, CCHFV infection is marked by common infection symptoms of high fever, malaise, myalgia, and often gastrointestinal distress . Disseminated intravascular coagulopathy, shock, and/or multi-organ failure are common endpoints for a fatal outcome of the disease. In fatal human cases, CCHFV is found in many tissues including the spleen, heart, lung, and intestine. Chief cellular targets of infection are mononuclear phagocytes, endothelial cells, and hepatocytes . The viral load in patients has been reported at 108–109 copies/mL with fatal cases purported to be slightly higher and maintained until succumbing . Immune response in the form of IgM and IgG production usually develops within 7–9 days of infection in humans. IgM and IgG antibodies are detectable for months or years after infection, respectively. However, failure to mount an antibody response almost always corresponds to a fatal outcome ."

We calculate the basic reproduction number ([Formula see text] ) by solving the differential equations of the model and also using next-generation matrix method. We also prove the global stability of the model using the Lyapunov method. We showed that when the [Formula see text] or [Formula see text] and [Formula see text] or [Formula see text] the disease-free and endemic equilibria asymptotic stability exist theoretically. We provide numerical simulations to demonstrate the detrimental impact of the direct and latent infections for the COVID-19 pandemic.","The COVID-19 is a novel contagious respiratory infection belong to the Coronaviruses family that causes illness ranging from a common cold to severe illness in humans like the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in adults and children [1, 2]. COVID-19 started in the city of Wuhan, Hubei Province, China, in 2019 and has spread to all parts of the world, affecting more than 200 countries and territories . It is the third coronavirus species to infect human populations in the past two decades [4–6]. As of 25 February 2021, there have been global confirmed cases of over 113 million, and 2.5 million resulted in deaths . Symptoms of the virus are fever, cough, shortness of breath, fatigue, body aches, headache, the loss of taste or smell, sore throat, congestion or runny nose, nausea or vomiting, and diarrhoea . Close contact and respiratory droplets within approximately 6 feet (1.8 m) are the most common primary causes of transmission . According to the World Health Organization (WHO), people who are infected but never developed any symptoms (asymptomatic people) and those who have not yet developed symptom but go on to develop symptoms later (pre-symptomatic people) can also infect others . That is, latent infection is possible and people who contracted the virus can spend between 2 and 14 days before signs and symptoms manifest [7, 10, 11]. Although most of those infected get cured without treatment, there is currently some vaccine and antiviral therapy to prevent contacting the virus. In a mild case, usual flu treatments like antibiotic drugs are used, and in severe cases, supportive treatment like a breathing machine is given to protect vital functions of the organs. The virus infects all ages of humans, but the higher risk is more on adult individuals with severe illness relating to respiratory diseases, organ diseases, and blood diseases ."
PMC7972560,2020-12-10,Development of a Simulator to Model the Spread of Coronavirus Infection in a Closed Space,"The outbreak of the novel coronavirus COVID-19 and its level of infectiousness, as well as its status as a global pandemic, has led to concerns about the most effective ways to reduce the transmission rate, however predicting the effectiveness of intervention strategies in a pandemic is difficult, hence the importance of simulating and modeling for understanding the spread of the disease. In this work we designed and developed a computer simulator to enable the study of infectious diseases evolutions, the simulator imitates random movements and positions of a given number of citizens in a closed space. It takes into account several parameters contamination ratio of the disease, contaminated ratio of population, and mask-wearing ratio. We also elaborated some experiments for studying the impact of the contamination ratio over the disease spreading, as a result for a sample of 100 citizens in a closed place, we used a combination of simulations for the aforementioned 3 parameters. The results show that there’s no significant impact of the contamination ratio of the disease over the number of contaminations per each generation, although it has an impact on the propagation speed.","As part of the fight against the COVID1-19 pandemic, the world has adopted several measures and imposed many restrictions to slow down the spread. By putting societies and economies on hold, we have curtailed the ability of the virus to spread through our communities. These defensive measures helped to limit some of the short-term impacts of the virus. Among its actions, social distancing standards prove to be essentials, limiting social and community contacts and increasing home isolation are embedded within the pandemic COVID-19 preparedness plans of most countries and appear in current WHO2 recommendations, in condition to plan for a phased transition away from such restrictions in a manner that will enable the sustainable suppression of transmission at a low-level . Social distancing interventions are important as they represent the only type of intervention measure guaranteed to be available against a novel infectious disease in the early phases of a pandemic. The goal of these interventions is to reduce the overall illness attack rate and the consequential excess mortality attributed to the pandemic and to delay and reduce the peak attack rate, reducing pressure on health services and allowing time to distribute and administer antiviral drugs, and possibly suitable vaccines."

In March 2020, the SARS-CoV-2 spread to Venezuela and Ecuador. The basic reproduction number ([Formula see text] ) is a value that allows measuring the transmission rate of a virus. The SIR model is the simplest compartmental epidemiological model (Susceptible, Infectious, and Recovered). The SIR model can be used to estimate [Formula see text] by fitting the curve of the infected compartment to the experimental curve of infected subjects per day. This work aims to study the projection of the [Formula see text] of SARS-CoV-2 in Venezuela and Ecuador. For this purpose, five experiments took place by adjusting the SIR model curve of the infected compartment to experimental data at five-time intervals (the first 14, 28, 42, 56, and 178 days for Ecuador data and 165 days for Venezuela data). The [Formula see text] fell from 6.923 to 1.003 (between experiments 2 and 3) for Venezuelan data, and from 3.622 to 1.022 (between experiments 1 and 2) for Ecuadorian data. These differences imply that [Formula see text] depends on the preventive measures implemented to face the pandemic. On the other hand, the number of infections in Ecuador is higher compared to the infection numbers in Venezuela in each experiment. Venezuela is experiencing a complex economic crisis that limits the ability of its citizens to mobilize due to the lack of gasoline, monetary liquidity, and failures in basics services, suggesting that the economic activity of the countries will also influence the number of infections.","A novel coronavirus caused an outbreak of atypical pneumonia in Wuhan, Hubei province in December of 2019, and then rapidly spread out in the whole of China [13, 39]. The virus formerly called SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2) by the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses. In February 13, 2020, there were over 60,000 reported cases (including more than 1,000 death report) in China . Since January 2020, the central government of China implemented preventive measures to avert the spreading of SARS-CoV-2  [9, 37]. Many cities in Hubei province applied a lookdown strategy, and many measures were implemented, such as tracing close contacts, quarantining infected cases, promoting social consensus on self-protection (wearing a face mask in a public area), and social distance [4, 22]. Despite all the measures implemented by the Chinese government to contain the spread of SARS-CoV-2, by March 2020 the virus had spread to North America, Europe, and South America [8, 24]. By the time of writing (October 9, 2020), the United States of America (with 7,863,045 of cases), India (with 6,964,074 of cases), and Brazil (with 5,035,744 of cases) are the countries with the highest number of infections in the world . Besides, the latest findings have shown that SARS-CoV-2 is an inflammatory infection in which mortality may increase in certain types of populations, such as the elderly  , patients with diabetes or associated metabolic diseases [7, 28, 31], patients with cancer , among others."
PMC7980166,2021-03-21,Integration of Deep Learning Machine Models with Conventional Diagnostic Tools in Medical Image Analysis for Detection and Diagnosis of Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19),"Novel coronavirus 19 (COVID-19) had made the lives of humans in dilemma since its outburst from Wuhan, China on December 31, 2019, and is declared as a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO). Its spread had been very rapid among the people which is a real task for the authorities to identify the persons infected with viruses and isolate them to prevent virus transmission. At present, various diagnostic aids are used in health care centres to screen the public with the symptoms of COVID-19. However, the use of conventional medical aids is of no use in early detection because of the rapid transmission rate. Therefore, researches are exploring Artificial Intelligence (AI) incorporated techniques that will aid physicians in the early detection of COVID-19 and one such method is Deep Learning Machine Models (DLM). This chapter aims to review research studies available in PubMed database with the Keywords COVID-19, Diagnosis, Deep learning models, and Medical Imaging till August 10, 2020 related to COVID-19 and DLM in medical image analysis. By evaluating 13 full text articles we calculated F1 scores for possible studies and concluded that studies with Computed Tomography (CT) had better diagnostic accuracy when compared to chest X-ray (CXR).","In December 2019 Wuhan provenance many people were infected with symptoms of fever, cough, and shortness of breath and are represented as severe unexplained pneumonia. Later this spread to many countries made the situation worse and resulted in deaths. In February 2020 World Health Organization (WHO) declared this condition as a pandemic and named the new virus as Novel Coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) . As there are no approved drugs in use for this new virus only treatment option is to reduce the disease severity with the existing drugs like Chloroquine, Remdesivir, and Fapilavir, etc. The prevention and control model for this pandemic is mentioned in Fig. 1
Early detection, reporting, and isolation of infected persons.Providing adequate necessary resources to all infected patients.Hospitalize all the suspected and virus-positive patients.
 As per Fig. 1, the biggest worry is the early detection, reporting, and isolation of the infected patients. Because the virus is spreading at a rapid pace so that existing medical facilities and medical aids are not enough to perform adequate viral testing. According to Liu et al. the virus, basic reproduction number (R0) is determined to be 2–3 which is high when compared to the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Virus (SARS) . Due to its high transmission rate existing medical tools like Computed Tomography (CT), reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), X-ray, and sputum test, etc. are not enough for early detection of COVID-19 cases also sometimes false negatives are being resulted. So researches are looking at advanced technologies like Artificial Intelligence to incorporate into diagnostic aids for rapid detection of viral screening. One of such techniques is Deep Learning Machine models (DLM) is a technique of AI that teaches computers to perform what naturally comes to humans. DLM is also used in areas like agriculture, mobile, and wireless networking, Internet of things, bio-informatics, and health management systems. One such application more frequent in use during the COVID-19 pandemic is lung image analysis models of corona infected patients. Because they will automate the characteristics of the symptoms of COVID-19 and also able to distinguish between the non-COVID-19 and COVID-19 persons in a very quick time. DLM performs various tasks such as classification, clustering, regression, image reconstruction, lesion detection, and segmentation.

PMC7981131,2020-07-31,Analytical and Numerical Solutions of a TB-HIV/AIDS Co-infection Model via Fractional Derivatives Without Singular Kernel,"Human beings, who have encountered a lot of diseases and viruses in the last century, conduct a lot of studies to defeat such diseases, particularly HIV, known as the human immunodeficiency virus, and AIDS disease known as advanced immunodeficiency syndrome. The said diseases can be quite dangerous for countries and even for the whole world as the mode of transmission and transmission rate of such diseases increase. The literature needs mathematical modeling and subsequent analysis of such diseases. In the light of this information, TB-HIV/AIDS coinfection model was analyzed. To this end, the model was firstly extended to the Caputo-Fabirizo fractional derivative obtained using the exponential function. Then, uniqueness solutions were investigated by the help of the fixed-point theorem. Thereafter, the uniqueness solution of the model was made by assuming certain parameters, and its stability analyzes were examined. Finally, numerical solutions of the mathematical model were made and its numerical simulations were shown.","In epidemiology, epidemic refers to a disease, which seems to be new cases, but has more than expected effects compared to previous experiences in a certain human population within a certain period. Epidemics have greatly affected cities, countries, continents and sometimes the entire world throughout human history. Epidemics have occurred in almost all ages. The examples include the bubonic plague known as the black plague that occurred in the middle ages and the Spanish flu that emerged at the end of the First World War. Viruses are the greatest factor in occurrence and spread of epidemics. For most of infectious diseases, the easiest way to catch the disease is direct contact with an infected person or animal. Types of direct contract can be listed as followsFrom person to person Infectious diseases usually spread by direct transfer of bacteria, viruses or other germs from one person to another. Bacteria or viruses can be transported if a person carrying bacteria or viruses sneezes, coughs, touches or hugs a healthy person.From animal to human Being bitten or scratched by an infected animal, including pets, can cause disease. Some infectious diseases, such as rabies or tetanus, can be fatal if left untreated.To unborn babies A pregnant woman can pass on germs that cause infectious diseases to her unborn baby. Some microbes can be transmitted through the placenta or breast milk.
 The new corona virus identified on 13/01/2020 and named COVID-19, which is thought to have emerged from Wuhan city of China, has an impact on the whole world. Although many countries try to take precautions, the virus, which is thought to have been transmitted from animal to human, is also passed on from person to person very simply and quickly.

PMC7982978,2021-03-23,Media Information Effect Hampering the Spread of Disease,"The media effect is expected to deliver appropriate information to the people, allowing them to prepare some provisions for the spread of a disease in advance. As discussed in Chap. 10.1007/978-981-33-6481-3_4, gargling, wearing a mask, or avoiding crowds to maintain a “social distance” may help to considerably reduce the transmission rate. The effect from such social preventive measures can be enhanced by the media through rumor, information obtained through personal networks, SNS, and, of course, mass media.","There are various opinions concerning the pros and cons of the media effect in the wake of COVID-19. Media supports people’s groundless terror by providing rootless information and dubious news, which should be called agitation. This is a negative effect from the media that can worsen a situation. In some cases, a certain authority or nation may intentionally control information by covering-up facts for their own benefit, rather than offering correct information to the worldwide public. However, it is also true that media effectively works to deliver useful information to the people, letting them prepare for oncoming waves of an epidemic in the near future. Such information drives people to be aware of risk and allows them to take some intermediate defense measures (IDMs), such as gargling or wearing a mask, as we discussed in Chap. 10.1007/978-981-33-6481-3_4, while people without such useful information are at a relative disadvantage. Information may be brought by the media, but also by neighbors through word-of-mouth. If this is the case, the diffusion of information to implement a mathematical model should be not depicted only by discounting the transmission rate of an epidemic, but should also consider how information propagates on an underlying network connecting individuals. Spreading “awareness” of a disease can play a significant role in reducing the infection, as has been observed by many previous studies of complex population networks.1 In order to address the effect of awareness upon an epidemic’s dynamics, this chapter considers the voluntary-vaccination dilemma whose template was introduced in Chap. 10.1007/978-981-33-6481-3_3, and has applied in both Chaps. 10.1007/978-981-33-6481-3_4 and 10.1007/978-981-33-6481-3_5, to characterize the decision-making process in a population."
PMC8040016,2021-04-12,A fuzzy approach in the study of COVID-19 pandemic in Brazil,"PURPOSE The COVID-19 pandemic has spread widely through the world. Most countries impose severe intervention measures to contain the spread of the virus, and this worldwide scenario has motivated the development of researches in all areas of knowledge. In this context, this paper presents a study about how intervention measures such as lockdown, partial lockdown, and no-lockdown help to impede the extent of the severe outbreak of COVID-19. METHODS Since mathematical models are used to describe population dynamics and the behavior of epidemics, this paper presents a fuzzy approach to describe the behavior of new daily cases of COVID-19 in Brazil based on the p-fuzzy dynamic systems, considering as input variables, the infected population and the environment action. The evaluated output variable is the level of infestation. RESULTS The results of a fuzzy model showed that intervention measures play a crucial role in determining the success of COVID-19 eradication programs, while there is no vaccine available for all the population. The proposed fuzzy model was developed by posing intervention measures and the results showed that to consider partial-lockdown helped to slow down the transmission rates of COVID-19 in the population, however the total lockdown is more effective, while the vaccine is not available. CONCLUSION Therefore, mathematical models consist of an effective tool to investigate the situation with intervention strategies and estimate the potential benefits and costs of different strategies. The fuzzy model proposed assists government decision-making in order to minimize the economic impacts caused by the pandemic.","The COVID-19 pandemic officially began in late 2019 on the Asian continent, in China, and has spread widely through the continent. Since the emergence of this infectious disease, it has been subsequently span to every continent of the world except Antarctica (Rodríguez-Morales et al. 2020). In Brazil, the Ministry of Health confirmed the first case of coronavirus in São Paulo, in Feb. 26, 2020. The rapid spread of COVID-19 pandemic has motivated the development of research in this area, and several research activities have been conducted for better understanding the origin, functions, treatments, and preventions of this novel coronavirus (Acter et al. 2020). According to Grzybowski et al. , it has demanded a quick response from governments in terms of planning contingency efforts that include the imposition of social isolation measures and an unprecedented increase in the availability of medical services. Rahaman et al.  suggest socio-health policies to be imposed, such as quarantine, social distancing, and lockdown measures to cripple the transmission of the virus. The sooner such measures are implemented, the shorter will be the term of the endemic."

To stop the conveyance of the coronavirus into the human body and to flatten the transmission rate curve, almost every country imposed a lockdown. In India, the emergency lockdown was imposed on the 24th of March 2020 which created an economic crisis in the country but proved a boon in disguise for the environment to improve its quality. The study analysed the statuses of air quality with respect to NO in pre and during the COVID-19 lockdown period in eight districts of India where tier I cities are located. Nitrous Oxide concentration was determined through Sentinel 5P satellites imagery and Central Pollution Control Board ground station data. The lockdown across the country has helped the environment to regain, and therefore, more studies are required to assess other parameters to explore the implementation of the provision of the well-planned lockdown of 1-week duration in a year for giving enough time to the environment to recuperate. These results show that the study areas (Ahmedabad, Hyderabad, Delhi, Kolkata, Mumbai, Chennai, Bengaluru, and Pune) have witnessed a significant drop in nitrogen dioxide (14–62%) as compared to the same period in 2019. This propose an idea that the devilish, COVID-19 lockdown has proved to be an unknown tool for tranquillizing air pollution (NO) during a lockdown within the Territory of Indian.","COVID-19, primarily a pneumonia symptom disease which bears similarity with early erupted SARS and MERS, emerged in Wuhan city of China in December 2019 . Soon, it became a global public health crisis after World Health Organisation (WHO) announced it as an international public health emergency on 30th January 2020. This categorized COVID-19 into a high-risk disease facing a vulnerable health care system with a mortality rate of 3.4% worldwide [2, 3]. In India, the first case of COVID-19 was officially declared in Kerala on late January 2020 . Many countries including India had implemented lockdown in order to reduce the human-to-human interactions and prevention of the transmission of the virus . Epidemic Diseases Act, 1897 was invoked by the Government of India under this pandemic scenario, and different activities such as large scale public gathering were not allowed; private and public transportation was restricted; all the academic institutions, industries, and markets were closed; fourteen days strict quarantine system was imposed for the suspected as well as infected persons; social distancing and many other strict measures were implemented for flattening the transmission rate curve. This resulted in a decrease in the production from different power plants and industries, which negatively affected the country’s social and economic structure, but at the same time, many positive effects, e.g. improvement in air quality, water quality, noise, and land surface temperature have also been observed in the country . As per the reports of WHO, more than seven million deaths are attributed each year around the world due to air pollution, and majority of them belong to developing countries such as India and China where air pollution levels are high. It is intriguing to study the air quality statuses during the lockdown period implemented in different cities of India."

The aim of this study was to use the relevant case reports and series to determine the percentage of newborns who test positive for COVID-19 who are born to COVID-19-positive mothers. Secondary outcomes included examining laboratory abnormalities among COVID-19-positive neonates, and any depicted placental abnormalities in COVID-19-positive mothers. For this purpose, systematic review was performed on all studies reporting primary data on fetus-mother pairs with COVID-19. Data bases were searched for studies that met our inclusion and exclusion criteria. RESULTS Final screening revealed 67 studies, from which the primary data of 1787 COVID-19 mothers were identified and had their pregnancy outcome analyzed. Only 2.8% of infants born to COVID-19-positive mothers tested positive, and this finding is identical to percentages reported in former Coronaviridae outbreaks, whereas 20% manifested with intrauterine hypoxia alongside placental abnormalities suggestive of heavy placental vaso-occlusive involvement. CONCLUSIONS These findings suggest that while vertical transmission is unlikely, there appears to be an underlying risk of placental insufficiency due to the prothrombotic tendency observed in COVID-19 infection. Guidelines for proper prophylactic anticoagulation in COVID-positive mothers need to be established.","COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019), which has been declared a pandemic in March 2020, has caused an unprecedented uncertainty within the scientific community. Contradictory scientific evidences are released almost every day, on every aspect of the pandemic from its pathogenesis, to the methods of transmission, and to the possible compassionate use of medications to combat it. Transplacental transmission of COVID-19 is one of the topics that have raised conflicting evidences across the globe. The dilemma about transplacental transmission of Coronaviridae is not exclusive to the current outbreak. To our knowledge, nine studies [1–9] from SARS-1 (Severe Acute Respiratory syndrome) and HKCoV (Hong Kong Coronavirus) and MERS (Middle East Respiratory syndrome) outbreaks were reported, ranging from case reports to retrospective case reviews, comprising 71 mother-infant pairs. Table 1 summarizes the findings of the nine studies. Two cases only have shown vertical transmission, a remarkable finding was the strong evidence in those reports of intrauterine fetal hypoxia possibly due to placental damage or even direct evidence of placental infarctions. Gagneur et al.  reported two cases of still birth that was preceded by fetal heart deceleration, whereas Wong et al.  and Jeong et al.  demonstrated placental infarction in three cases. Analysis of placental outcomes was largely lacking in the studies performed in the previous outbreaks; however, all studies that mentioned the presence of placental vascular compromise namely Wong et al.  and Jeong et al.  excluded the presence of any maternal co-morbidity that can cause such finding (Table 1). The latter finding might signify that CoV are mainly implicated in the thrombotic injury observed in such case reports. The vascular tropism of COVID-19 has recently gained so much interest, and many of its multi-organ manifestations has been attributed to its endothelial tropism. Such endothelial tropism is accounted for by the high load of Angiotensin Converting Enzyme 2 (ACE2) and Furin [10, 11], which are important viral checkpoints, in the endothelium. The placenta is a vascular organ, in which Furin plays an important role in its differentiation; moreover, ACE2 and angiotensin 1-7 are heavily expressed in it, making the placenta an important target for the vascular tropic effect of COVID-19. As mentioned earlier, the conflicting evidence regarding vertical transmission of COVID-19 and the effect of maternal COVID-19 on newborns and their placenta, render systematic review of the clustered cases available of utmost importance to build stronger evidence for the neonatal outcomes of COVID-19. The primary outcome parameter of this systematic review is the percentage of newborns testing positive to COVID-19 mothers, while secondary outcome parameters included the assessment of laboratory abnormalities among COVID-19 newborns, and the placental abnormalities encountered in COVID-19 mothers.
 A computer run has been performed in EMBASE, MEDLINE, and the Cochrane Central Register (From 1 November 2019 to 1 of August 2020). The following terms were included in the search “COVID-19” OR “SARS-CoV-2” (Severe Acute Respiratory syndrome Coronaviridae 2) AND “Pregnancy” AND “Perinatal”."
PMC8080490,2021-04-28,An Advanced Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Recovered model for quantitative analysis of COVID-19,"The infectious diseases with a viral origin are of significant worldwide concern. In recent times, pandemics are creating havoc across the entire globe. This paper presents a constructive analysis of a new mathematical concept that will help the medical authorities to predict and to take controlling measures. In this work, we use ordinary first-order differential equations and compartmental model analysis for calculation of infection rate, transmission rate, and reproduction number of the patients. A new Advanced Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Recovered model has been introduced, which has greater accuracy of the reproduction number. The prediction of mode of disease transmission demonstrates the performance characteristics of the proposed model.","In this paper, we propose a mathematical model that is capable of calculating reproduction number and is able to predict the mode of transmission of COVID-19. According to state-of-the art of COVID-19 [11–15] authors have mainly used ordinary first-order differential equations and compartmental model analysis (CMA) for calculation of transmission rate and reproduction number, but such methods suffer from low accuracy. In this work we propose an Advanced Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Recovered (ASEIR) model in which we introduce additional compartments, namely quarantined (Q), diagnosed (J), and the environmental reservoir (V). The inclusion of the environmental compartment into the model affects the reproduction number to a great extent, thereby increasing the accuracy of the quantification. In order to formulate the control strategies, our major contributions are as followsKnowing the severity of the pandemic by calculating basic reproduction number.Prediction of the graph of the infectious patients and its comparison to the reported graph.Prediction of the mode of transmission of the disease."
PMC8110695,2021-05-11,When robots contribute to eradicate the COVID-19 spread in a context of containment,"In the era of autonomous robots, multi-targets search methods inspired researchers to develop adapted algorithms to robot constraints, and with the rising of Swarm Intelligence approaches, Swarm Robotics became a very popular topic. In this paper, the problem of searching for an exponentially increasing number of targets in a complex and unknown environment is addressed. Our main objective is to propose a Robotic target search strategy based on the Elephants Herding Optimization (EHO) algorithm, namely Robotic-EHO (REHO). The main additions were the collision-free path planning strategy, the velocity limitation, and the extension to the multi-target version in discrete environments. The proposed method has been the subject of many experiments, emulating the search of infected individuals by COVID-19 in a context of containment within complex and unknown random environments, as well as in the real case study of the USA. The particularity of these environments is their increasing targets’ number and the dynamic Containment Rate (CR) that we propose. The experimental results show that REHO reacts much better in high CR, early start search mission, and where the robots’ speed is higher than the virus spread speed.","After the appearance of the SARS in 2002, A(H1N1) in 2009, MERS in 2012, and Ebola in 2014, viruses continue to emerge and spread in 2019 with the new SARS-CoV-2 called COVID-19. The latter was declared as a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO) in March 2020. Subsequently, the focus of recent research has been on modeling approaches to estimate the outbreak growth and the impact of different individual and governmental measures to stop the spread of the COVID-19. Almost all studies noticed the impressive growing number of infected people and agree on the importance of active surveillance, contact tracing, containment, quarantine, and early strong social distancing efforts to stop the transmission of the virus, in addition to the need for massive screening of potentially infected individuals in order to isolate them. This last point can be linked to a problem of searching for targets in a complex and unknown environment, where the targets may be potentially affected individuals. The search will then be guided by contact tracing methods in a containment context. As reported in , in the Target Detection Problems (TDP) the objective is to find or detect one or multiple targets in a given environment. They may be tackled with one or multiple sensors. When mobile sensors are exploited, it is referred to as a mobile search, the problem becomes related to path planning. Target search is known as one of the benchmark problems in Swarm Robotics (SRs), which are basically Multi-Robots Systems (MRSs) with some special properties. Mobile robots can operate in complex and unknown environments by removing the need for human intervention. They perform tasks that humans cannot accomplish or are risky for them with reduced cost by the application of Swarm Intelligence (SI) algorithms [2, 3]. This paper proposes an extension of Elephants Herding Optimization (EHO) [4, 5] to SRs, named as REHO (Robotic-EHO), taking into account real-robots limits and an obstacle avoidance strategy. REHO is a Swarm Intelligence approach adapted for dynamic multi-target search in complex and unknown environments, where dynamicity is expressed by the variable Containment Rate and target’s number growing exponentially. The contribution of this paper is summarized in two points first, based on existing static environments representation for targets’ search problem, we propose a representation of dynamic environments to represent the COVID-19 (and other close-contact pathogens) spread and evolution in the time (days). To our knowledge, this modeling for TDP has never been proposed before. Then, we propose a Robotic adaptation of EHO algorithm (REHO) inspired by the herding behavior of elephant groups for the position update. A collision free path planning strategy is then provided for discrete environments (sampling-based). Such a result is exploited in this work to break the transmission chain and eradicate the COVID-19 spread."
PMC8126599,2021-05-17,Interplay of weather variables in triggering the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 infection in Asia,"Weather variables are one of the crucial factors affecting respiratory infectious diseases; however, the effect of weather variables on the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is still inconclusive and varies in different regions. The present study investigated the effects of weather variables (maximum temperature, MT; relative humidity, RH; wind speed, WS; precipitation, PR; and dew point, DP) on daily infection and death cases in three lockdown phases in Asia as of November 1, 2020. Generalized additive lag model was used to analyze the risk associated with weather variables, with confounders like median age of the national population, population density, country and lockdown phases. Our findings revealed that during lockdown phases all five weather variables show association with daily confirmed, and death cases. On the other hand, PR (pre-lockdown phase) and DP (lockdown phase) showed positive association with both daily confirmed and death cases. Throughout the three lockdown phases MT, RH and PR showed strong positive associations with daily confimed/death cases. A lag period of 0–4-days possess higher risk of infection and death due to the varied ratios of different weather variables. The relative risk indicated that the infection and mortality risk was higher in India as compared to the rest of the countries. Here, unique combination of weather variables together with higher population density makes this region as one of the hotspots for COVID-19. This shows that the COVID-19 pandemic may be suppressed or enhanced with combination of different weather conditions together with factors like population density and median age of the country, which shall be useful for better implementation of health policies and further preparedness in Asia. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION The online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s42398-021-00176-8.","Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), a strain of coronavirus is responsible for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), a predominantly respiratory ailment which is responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic (Gorbalenya et al. 2020). COVID-19 was first reported in Wuhan, China in December 2019 which soon spread to different parts of the world despite many restrictions in travel and so many preventive measures taken. Therefore, it was declared a pandemic by World Health Organization (WHO) because of its rapid spread throughout the world (Li et al. 2020). Previous studies showed weather variables like temperature and relative humidity can significantly help in occurrence and transmission of many infectious diseases, including severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) (Djennad et al. 2018; Tan et al. 2005). Recently, it was observed that weather variables, particularly mean temperature and relative humidity have significant associations with the occurrence of COVID-19 reported from different regions of the world (Bashir et al. 2020; Lin et al. 2020; Liu et al. 2020; Prata et al. 2020; Wu et al. 2020; Xie and Zhu 2020). Few researchers also considered diurnal temperature, wind speed, precipitation and dew point and found significant association with COVID-19 cases (Ma et al. 2020; Menebo 2020; Sahin 2020). It has been observed that the lethality in temperate countries is more as compared to tropical countries due to presence of few unique mutations in SARS-CoV-2 genes (Islam et al. 2020). Mutations in virulence genes of SARS-CoV-2 was observed in several countries of Europe, Asia and Middle-East, yet the loss of human lives due to COVID-19 has been relatively lower particularly in Asia and Middle-East as compared to Europe (Islam et al. 2020; Maurya et al., 2020). Therefore, the significance of weather variables is important for the occurrence and spread of COVID-19 and its rate of lethality. Due to this pandemic, most of the countries of the world have imposed partial or complete social restrictions resulting in prohibition of mass transportation and industrial activities. As a result, the air quality and overall environmental health has improved with drastic reductions in pollution (Bera et al. 2020; Mahato et al. 2020)."
PMC8139550,2021-05-21,"Modeling the COVID-19 spread, a case study of Egypt","In this article, the authors applied a logistic growth model explaining the dynamics of the spread of COVID-19 in Egypt. The model which is simple follows well-known premises in population dynamics. Our aim is to calculate an approximate estimate of the total number of infected persons during the course of the disease. The model predicted—to a high degree of correctness—the timing of the pandemic peak [Formula see text] and the final epidemic size [Formula see text] ; the latter was foreseen by the model long before it was announced by the Egyptian authorities. The estimated values from the model were also found to match significantly with the nation reported data during the course of the disease. The period in which we applied the model was from the first of April 2020 until the beginning of October of the same year. By the time the manuscript was returned for revision, the second wave swept through Egypt and the authors felt obliged to renew their study. Finally, a comparison is made with the SIR model showing that ours is much simpler; yet leading to the same results.","Models for predicting how epidemics are spread in a certain community are not only numerous but also dating from the early twentieth century. They are of two kinds the first is statistical in nature; i.e. like fitting data to a curve and then extrapolating from there. The second are the mechanistic models simulating future transmission scenarios under a list of assumptions. The first type is usually used for short-term forecasts using machine learning or regression allowing for quick projections that are useful for policy makers. The famous model presented by the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) falls into this category . These models are generally not suited for long-term predictions; to the least anticipating the date of the pandemic peak. On the contrary, mechanistic models are well suited for epidemiological dynamics like when the peak will occur or whether a revival will happen. They can also deal better with large populations. They also allow for nonlinear feedback; like the more persons are infected the faster the pandemic spreads. Therefore, they are well-fitted for inference about intervention efficacy. The model we applied is a logistic growth model which falls into this category. Of the early mechanistic models is the SIR; short for Susceptible–Infected–Recovered, which was designed by Kermack and McKendrick . In this model, the authors considered a fixed population by modeling three variables the susceptible, the infected and the recovered. They are called compartments because people may progress between them. The order of the label denotes the flow pattern from left to right. Like it is understood, the first group is not yet infected; yet it can be at any time, the second group comprises those already infected and can therefore transmit the disease to others, while the last group although at one time contracted the disease but are now recovered. The model goes on describing the rules upon which the flow proceeds between these three categories. In fact, the SIR model paved the way for future research with some alterations or say assumptions; e.g. the SEIR model (Susceptible–Exposed–Infectious–Recovered) or SEIRS (susceptible–exposed–infectious–recovered–susceptible) types, depending on whether the acquired immunity is permanent or not. In other words, a distinction is made between those models describing diseases that grant lifelong immunity and those which do not. The first case leads to the so-called SIR type models, the second to the SIS type models. Some models further added extensive complexities like a nonlinear transmission rate leading to some chaotic and hyper-chaotic dynamical behaviors . Some investigated the uncertainty of the parameters fed into the model [4, 5]; e.g. health care management, the natural history of the disease, possible survey biases, the transmission behavioral factors, the sampling or measurement errors, etc.… Determining the sensitivities to changes in these parameter values will help identify those key parameters that can help the decision makers explore various policies . In general, not that modeling needs a laborious effort on the part of the modeler, but demands also a substantial team of specialists, whether in virology, medicine, epidemiology, ecology, public health, policy makers, statistics, computer simulation experts, etc.… and sponsored by large institutions . That is due to the many assumptions and parameters involved in the study. The latter usually lasts several months in order to test conceptual results such as thresholds, the transmission characteristics of the disease, how can the basic reproduction number be monitored regularly, assessing quantitative conjectures, whether the model applies with/without therapy intervention, what/how crucial data are collected. Again, whether the incubation period varies from one person to another, what is the average recovery period, how and when antibodies develop and whether the person remains contagious for a while, etc.… A simple review to the literature reveals the rapid growth of epidemiology modeling by researchers and how diverse is the list of acronyms in describing the flow patterns between the different compartments. A few examples only of those acronyms are the SIR, SIS, SEI, SEIS, SIRS, SEIR, SEIRS models and so on…."
PMC8178648,2021-06-05,How social innovations spread globally through the process of reverse innovation: a case-study from the South Korea,"Nowadays, innovation is no longer a peculiarity of developed economies. Indeed, more frequently, it occurs that innovations born in the so called ""emerging countries"" spread in the advanced ones. This phenomenon is well known as Reverse innovation (RI), and within the global innovation literature about RI, some authors refer to these reversed innovations as developed in order to solve social or economic issues, specific of emerging contexts. However, scholars use to connect innovation with social goal as primary benefit to another phenomenon i.e., Social innovation (SI). Within the Social innovation literature, there is a lack concerning how it should be undertaken to spread globally. Thus, we applied the Reverse innovation process to Social innovations through a case-study analysis, we link the two phenomena which have never been explored together in previous studies. The paper aims at understanding how Social innovations spread from emerging to more advanced markets, while implementing this inversion of the flow. Further, we want to explore which is the potential that a Social innovation has in the host market in other words, if SI could lose, hold, reduce, or increase their original social connotation.","The recent pandemic era, caused by the spread of Covid-19, challenged people, economies, and the global health. In order to try to contain and limit the damages caused by the virus, several countries proposed different innovations concerning the testing and screening phase, or the treatment and the prevention to this disease. As a matter of fact, the deaths rate in some countries has been less impactful than in other geographic areas some of the so called “emerging countries” with high innovative potential (i.e., South Korea) handled the pandemic better than the “advanced countries” (U.S. and United Kingdom), registering less Covid-19 deaths. These data (Fig. 1) have been collected through the platform “Our world in data” (OWID), an online database which includes data on confirmed cases, deaths, and tests performed. This result is due to different reasons, which might be considered. Certainly, we could not ignore a potential divergence in data gathering; for instance, some countries counted only hospital deaths, whilst others may include deaths in home and the cumulative confirmed Covid-19 deaths could suffer of inaccuracies because of the limited testing and the challenge in attribution of the cause of death. Secondly, even if some of the African and Asian countries do not have better standard of living in terms of income per capita, density of populations or public infrastructures, they already experienced in the past with similar health issues such as Ebola, SARS or Mers. For instance, South Korea learned the lesson of Mers (Han et al., 2020) and was able to perform around 15.000–20.000 detection tests per day, working closely to the private sector they simply know better how to deal with these plagues. Thirdly, nowadays, emerging countries are developing their own innovative skills and capabilities, building their specific innovations."
PMC8180358,2021-06-06,Effects of meteorological parameters on COVID-19 transmission trends in Bangladesh," Understanding the influence of meteorological parameters in relation to COVID-19 transmission may be a convenient way to predict the ongoing pandemic towards its adaptive control measures. This study aims to explore the association between COVID-19 cases and meteorological parameters and to predict COVID-19 transmission for an extended period covering different climatic patterns. The number of COVID-19 cases, daily records of rainfall, temperature, relative humidity and wind speed data were collected for April and May 2020 from the eight major divisions in Bangladesh. The basic statistical analyses and auto regressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) using SPSS tool were applied to evaluate and explore association between meteorological parameters and COVID-19 cases and its transmission trend. A greater number of significant positive associations (r = 0.24–0.58) is found to exist between the relative humidity and COVID-19 cases across the cities, while with temperature both positive and negative associations (r = − 0.23 to 0.72) were revealed. Furthermore, both the rainfall and wind speed exhibit positive correlations. ARIMA model portrayed predictive trend of COVID-19 transmission, from its inception on 8 March 2020 to September 2020, in Bangladesh. The month of July showed the highest daily COVID-19 cases prior to lowering at steady rate till September illustrating the influnce of meteorological parameters.

Till the date of writing of this manuscript, over 3 million people in 185 countries with different climatic and geographical regions have been affected by this virus. The novel coronavirus is highly transmissible in by direct contact or staying closer than 3–6 m of infected person. Among a few measures to avoid its transmission, maintaining social distance, wearing masks, washing hands and cloths are being advised by the World Health Organisation (WHO) and the respective health organizations locally and internationally. With a baffling situation of coronavirus attack, different countries had initiated lockdown measures at first instance against its spreading and imposed health regulations advised by the WHO. In relation to this, initially three cases of COVID-19 infection were registered on March 8, 2020 in Bangladesh (IEDCR 2020). Thereafter, considering the increased number of cases and as advised by the WHO, the Government of Bangladesh (GoB) declared an almost 10 days complete shutdown on 16 March 2020 to be executed from 26 March 2020 to 4 April 2020, at first instance. However, the lockdown continued till 30 May 2020 following six more declarations of lockdown (Shawon 2020). While the lockdown measures resulted in rejuvenation of environment, the country's economy was significantly during this period. Subsequently, a decision to resume garment industries, a major economic head, maintaining health regulations, on 26 April, 2020, eventually put the lockdown measures and effects go in vain (Haque and Ahamad 2020). Moreover, starting other businesses as usual from 31 May 2020, Bangladesh saw its worst scenarios of affected cases with an average of approximately 3% of total tests conducted and 1.8% incremental rate of total affected, along with the positive trends in death tolls (IEDCR 2020). The figures were not as hopeless as compared with other countries, however, no positive picture is visible even after 110 days since its arrival in Bangladesh. In contrast, putting ban on people movement and closing down the business activities during lockdown period, the benefits to environment, in particular with lowering of air pollutants were reported and are documented from different regions (Kerimray et al. 2020; Masum and Pal 2021; Menebo 2020; Shahzad et al. 2020; Tobías et al. 2020), illustrated the magnitudes of benefits that are found to vary with different urban settings, population density, income level and meteorological backgrounds. Considering the climatic variability exists in different parts of the world and to address the question whether climatic factors have influenced spreading of SARS-Cov-2 virus, a few recent studies are found reporting the relationship coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) with climatic variables (Biktasheva 2020; Ma et al. 2020; Menebo 2020; Qi et al. 2020). For example, Ahmadi et al.  investigated the effects of climatic parameters on COVID-19 outbreak in Iran and found that temperature and rainfall have positive relationship, while that with the humidity, wind speed and solar radiation were negative in terms of the number of infected cases. Another study by Biktasheva  found that local air humidity has negative correlation with COVID-19 mortality in German federal states. In this line, positive correlation for diurnal temperature (r = 0.44) but negative for relative humidity (r =  − 0.32) with COVID-19 daily mortality counts in Wuhan, China were reported by Ma et al. . This study also revealed that absolute humidity has a positive correlation with the death counts. In contrast, Qi et al.  reported that both temperature and humidity are negatively correlated with COVID-19 transmission in Mainland China, and very similar findings with climatic variables have been reported by Şahin  for 9 major cities in Turkey. Furthermore, Menebo  noted the maximum, minimum, average temperature, and wind speed have positive connotation with daily new cases, while the precipitation exhibited negative association in Oslo, Norway. Another study by Tosepu et al.  reported that the temperature, humidity and rainfall exhibit positive association with the COVID-19 cases in Jakarta, Indonesia. All these studies claimed the association of climatic factors on COVID-19 cases and death tolls. It is clear from the outcomes of these studies that the climatic parameters might have associations with COVID-19 cases and the variabilities in transmission and the death tolls are not unexpected in different regions; hence, a few more local/regional studies may not only further help in consolidating the impact of climatic patterns from the less reported countries/regions but also to be a useful way for adopting appropriate control measures. Hence, it is worth to investigate the effects of meteorological parameters on cases and death toll to predict the probable scenarios. To best of our knowledge the prediction of the ongoing pandemic pattern with climatic variables are not yet to explored fully. Unlike other studies, this study also explored precipitation influences as an additional climatic variable along with other variables aligned with aforesaid studies on COVID-19 cases. Also, study addresses whether there exists the variability within the country with respect to different climatic zones in eight administrative divisions in Bangladesh. Furthermore, the study explores the probability trend of COVID-19 transmission using statistical tools to portray the association of COVID-19 cases with climatic variables, that can be helpful to check, plan ahead."
PMC8200798,2021-06-14,The impact of the undetected COVID-19 cases on its transmission dynamics,"OBJECTIVE The COVID-19 pandemic is currently ongoing. Presently, due to the unavailability of a definitive vaccine to decrease its acquiring, it’s essential to understand its transmissibility in the community by undetected cases to control its transmission. This study aims to study this context using mathematical modelling. METHODS A COVID-19 transmission model was framed that estimated the basic reproduction number [Formula see text] (a measurement of disease risk) using the next-generation method. It explored the contribution of exposed and infected (detected and undetected) individuals, and environmental pathogen to the overall risk of infection spreading, utilizing the publicly reported data of this infection in Maharashtra between March 22, 2020, and May 4, 2020. A sensitivity analysis was performed to study the effect of a rising number of undetected cases to [Formula see text] . RESULTS The estimated basic reproduction number is [Formula see text] , which increases rapidly with the rise in the undetected COVID-19 cases. Although the exposed individuals made the largest contribution to infection transmission ([Formula see text] ), the contaminated environment also played a significant role. CONCLUSIONS It is crucial to identify the individuals exposed and infected to COVID-19 disease and isolate them to control its transmission. The awareness of the role of fomites in infection transmission is also important in this regard.","World Health Organization (WHO) declared the ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) epidemic as a Global Public Health Emergency of International Concern on January 30, 2020 . COVID-19 started from China in December 2019 [2, 3], which is caused by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), an enveloped single-stranded RNA virus of zoonotic origin [1, 3]. India has 182143 number of active COVID-19 cases and 5164 number of deaths as of May 31, 2020. Since there is no effective therapeutics or licensed vaccine to combat novel COVID-19 [1, 4], contact tracing and quarantining  is one of the major strategies adopted by India to control its transmission and mortality. But, while interviewing the COVID-19 infected individuals for contact tracing, some contacts may be missed due to recall bias. Such missed COVID-19 infected individuals who remain asymptomatic during its incubation period (2–14 days), increases the risk of community transmission unknowingly .Therefore, it is crucial to study their role in disease transmission."
PMC8208061,2021-06-16,Effectiveness of different facemask materials to combat transmission of airborne diseases,"The pandemic COVID-19, caused by SARS-COV-2 virus has shaken the entire world with no such remedy till date. The only possible way to stop transmission of SARS-COV-2 is to take safety precautions including use of facemask. With the ever-increasing concern on the disease, it is necessary to choose facemask components to achieve the performance as good as commercially available N95 masks in a cost-effective way. This investigation compares the effectiveness of five different 3-layered masks with N95 mask in terms of pressure drop and aerosol filtration capabilities. Different combinations of cotton, polypropylene fabric, tissue and high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) were used as mask materials. In comparison to N95 mask, the result shows that the 3-layered cotton mask has much lesser pressure drop but least droplet filtration efficiency, while polypropylene-HEPA-polypropylene mask is seen as the best cost-effective alternative to N95 in terms of droplets filtration efficiency and breathability. These findings are crucial to make the right non-medical facemask to combat COVID-19 and other airborne diseases. [Image see text]","To prevent spreading of the ongoing COVID 19 pandemic caused by SARS-COV-2 virus, substantial safety precautions are the preliminary steps to be considered. It has already been established that the SARS-COV-2 not only spreads via contact with an infected person, but also through aerosol transmission [1, 2]. In this regard, wearing of facemask is recommended to restrict aerosols generated while speaking, coughing, sneezing or even during breathing . Such aerosols act as a transport medium to transmit the respiratory pathogens since the sizes of the pathogens are in the nanoscale (~ 150 nm for SARS-COV-2) . Extensive studies reveal the fact that while larger sized aerosols get settled within a meter or so, fine aerosols remain suspended in air for several hours [5, 6]. Such fine virus contaminated aerosols are able get into deeper part of the respiratory track thereby causing infection . A recent work on influenza virus reveals the presence of significant amounts of viral RNA in emitted aerosols during natural breathing, without coughing or sneezing . These aerosols can travel for long distances with the air flow and can be inhaled by people surrounding the infected person. In order to stop such type of viral transmission, the demand for efficient face mask capable of restricting the flow of aerosol bearing pathogens has increased considerably. The critical requirement for a mask is that the filter components should be capable of preventing the penetration of hazardous particles within a range of sizes over a range of airflow (approximately 10 to 100 l/min). To curtail airborne transmission, different kinds of masks such as, surgical masks, protective masks with filtering face seal, respirators, antibacterial masks for common people, traffic police, doctors and patients exist. In case of the very familiar N95/N99, the number after the N signifies the percentage of filtration capability of those masks. For the respirators, face seal leakage must be minimized. Breathability, hydrophobic nature and flammability are important parameters that decide the standard of a mask. The breathability of masks purely depends on the fibrous material arrangement in the filter medium. The use of thick micro fibrous coating can increase the filtration efficiency at the expense of breathability. To ease breathability in high particle filtration mask, there should be an optimum resistance offered by the facemask during breathing. This necessitates the need for measuring the differential pressure across the mask. The analysis for the differential pressure must be carried out at the standard flow rate of 85 (l/min), i.e., 3 CFM (cubic feet per minute) - the condition under heavy exercise . Konda et al   has done the analyses at 1.2 and 3.2 CFM for different fabrics with sample area of 59 cm2. They found that the average differential pressure at 1.2 CFM across all the fabrics was 2.5 ± 0.4 Pa, which indicates low resistance and excellent breathability. The US Code of Federal Regulations also gives the standards for the differential pressure 42 CFR Part 84.172 states that the maximum allowable resistance for non-powered N, R and P types mask should be 35 mm (343.2 Pa) of H2O for inhalation and 25 mm (245.1 Pa) of H2O for exhalation. Kim and his co-workers  found 29.4 Pa, 58.8 Pa and 88.2 Pa pressure drop for different filters at 85 l/min air flow rate . Another important parameter is the hydrophobic nature of the filter material in the innermost and the outermost layers to resist the aerosols generated during sneezing, coughing, and other human actions to enter the inner filter components."

The recently established similarity between beta-coronavirus strains in animals and humans led us to hypothesize that previous contact with infected dogs or cattle could shield humans from the circulating SARS-CoV-2 virus. We further believe that our hypothesis, if confirmed by further studies, could be used as a potential vaccine strategy.","Modern transport converts the world into a global village, allowing the rapid spread of infectious diseases. The current COVID-19 pandemic has spread to over 210 countries around the globe, including India. The SARS-CoV-2, like any other respiratory virus, is transmitted from an infected person to a susceptible host, through droplets, and surface contact. There are currently seven characterized coronavirus strains (229E, NL63, OC43, HKU1, SARS, MERS, and SARS-CoV-2) known to be infective to humans. Out of these, four strains cause milder forms of infection, while three others, including SARS-CoV-2, cause severe illnesses."
PMC8219013,2021-05-29,The preventive measures adopted during dental practice by the dentists in a low-income country to prevent the transmission of COVID-19: A questionnaire-based survey,"OBJECTIVES A novel coronavirus was first proclaimed in Hubei province, China, 213 countries worldwide also became an epicenter of the virus until June 17, 2020. The dental team has a high risk of infection as a result of the specificity of their procedures. The aim of this questionnaire was to estimate the preventive measures and the awareness methods that may be adopted by the dentists to prevent or reduce the transmission of COIVD-19. MATERIAL AND METHODS The questionnaire was an electronic survey contained 23 questions, which were designed based on the instruction given for dental setting by CDC during COVID-19 pandemic; the respondents in this study were dental practitioners in Syria. RESULTS A total of 1013 dentists have responded to this survey 61% of the participants treated only the emergent treatment, 84% of them wear facial masks, while the prevalence for other protective equipment was low. The majority of the participants schedule the appointments as there is only one patient in the waiting room. More than half of the dentists sterilize the patients’ hands before and after the dental treatment, and 59% of them choose 70% ethyl alcohol as a disinfectant. Most of the respondents use dental mouthwashes before the initiation of the treatment. Almost three-quarters of the dentists use high vacuum. Only 15% of dentists sterilize the dental handpieces in the autoclaves after each patient. Most of dentists educate their patients about preventive methods. CONCLUSION Based on these results, the Syrian dentists should take more strict measures during dental practice.","A novel coronavirus (SARS-Cov-2) caused severe pneumonia (COVID-19) explored in Wuhan city, Hubei province, China, and then spread rapidly to other provinces and countries. On June 17, 2020, 213 countries have reported cases of COVID-19.[2,3] The World Health Organization declared the COVID-19 as a public health emergency of international concern. The most common and typical clinical symptoms of the patients with coronavirus disease were fatigue, fever (88.7%), and coughing (67.8%); however, nausea and diarrhea (5% and 3.8%, respectively) were uncommon. The radiological findings showed that 56.4% of the patients have ground-glass opacity, and 51.8% have bilateral patchy shadowing in CT chest. Laboratory findings showed that lymphocytes were present in 83.2% of the patients. The most common transmission route of coronavirus is direct contact with the coughing and sneezing patient’s droplet. Furthermore, it can also be transmitted from person to person by direct or indirect contact. The dental staff has the risk of coronavirus infection due to the specificity of their procedures such as face-to-face communication, direct contact with saliva, and micro-organism inhalation that may be remained in the air for a long time. Therefore, infection control and preventive measures should be very strict during dental diagnosis and treatment, especially that doctors get infected with COVID-19 more. The aim of this study was to estimate the infection prevention and control (IPC) that may be adopted for both patients and dental team in the Syrian Arab Republic (SAR) dental clinics."
PMC8219482,2021-06-21,Effects of lockdown on acute coronary syndrome incidence in an area without community transmission of COVID-19,"OBJECTIVE To assess the changes in cardiac hospitalisations, acute coronary syndromes (ACS) and out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OOHCA) during COVID-19 isolation compared with prior time periods in an area of low COVID-19 disease incidence. METHODS Review of all cardiology admissions, non-ST segment elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI), ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) requiring urgent catheter laboratory activation and OOHCA. The 10-week period of government-imposed social isolation (23 March–31 May 2020) was compared with the same period in 2018, 2019 and a 10-week period prior to social isolation (6 January–15 March 2020). Incidence rate ratios were calculated. Symptom to balloon time was also compared for those requiring catheterisation laboratory activation for STEMI. RESULTS The incidence of COVID-19 in the health district was 0.14 per 100 000 per day during the isolation period. There was a significant reduction in cardiology hospitalisations, NSTEMI and STEMI presentations without changes in OOHCA or symptom to balloon time for STEMI. CONCLUSIONS We observed a significant decline in cardiology presentations during social isolation without widespread COVID-19 disease. This provides further evidence for the important influence of social and behavioural factors on coronary event rates.","During the COVID-19 pandemic, widespread use of social isolation has been instituted to reduce disease spread. A decrease in acute coronary syndrome (ACS) related hospital admissions was noted among populations with high rates of COVID-19.1 However, these results were significantly impacted by confounding due to high rates of COVID-19 transmission. During the mandatory lockdown period in the Hunter New England (HNE) region of Australia, with a total population of approximately 950 000, there was very low community transmission of COVID-19.2 This has allowed the establishment of a natural control group to examine the true effects of social isolation on ACS incidence rates, independent of the impact of widespread COVID-19 disease and transmission. We examined the rates of the following types of admissions total cardiology, non-ST segment elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI), primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) for ST segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) and out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OOHCA) emergency department presentations to the John Hunter Hospital, the only tertiary hospital of the region."
PMC8247836,2021-04-21,COVID-19 Transmission Dynamics: A Space-and-Time Approach," At the end of January 2021, Portugal had over 700,000 confirmed COVID-19 cases. The burden of COVID-19 varies between and within countries due to differences in contextual and individual factors, transmission rates, and clinical and public health interventions. OBJECTIVES To identify high-risk areas, between April and October, on a weekly basis and at the municipality level, and to assess the temporal evolution of COVID-19, considering municipalities classified by incidence levels. METHODS This is an ecological study following a 3-step approach, i.e.,  calculation of the relative risk (RR) of the number of new confirmed COVID-19 cases, weekly, per municipality, using a spatial scan analysis;  classification of the municipalities according to the European Centre for Disease Control incidence categorization on November 19; and  characterization of RR temporal evolution by incidence groups. RESULTS Between April and October, the mean RR was 0.53, with a SD of 1.44, varying between 0 and 46.4. Globally, the north and Lisbon and Tagus Valley (LVT) area were the regions with the highest number of municipalities with a RR above 3.2. In April and beginning of May, most of the municipalities with an RR above 3.2 were from the north, while between May and August most municipalities with an RR above 3.2 were from LVT area. Comparing the incidence in November and retrospectively analyzing the RR showed the huge variation, with municipalities with an RR of 0 at a certain time classified as extremely high in November. CONCLUSIONS Our results showed considerable variation in RR over time and space, with no consistent “better” or “worst” municipality. In addition to the several factors that influence COVID-19 transmission dynamics, there were some outbreaks over time and throughout the country and this may contribute to explaining the observed variation. Over time, on a weekly basis, it is important to identify critical areas allowing tailored and timely interventions in order to control outbreaks in early stages.","COVID-19 was first reported in China at the end of 2019. On January 30, the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a Public Health Emergency of International Concern, and on March 11 it was declared a pandemic . The first case in Portugal was reported on March 2n and by the end of January 2021 Portugal had almost 700,000 confirmed cases and 12,000 deaths . The burden of COVID-19 varies between and within countries [3, 4] due to differences in contextual and individual factors, transmission rates, and clinical and public health interventions . The rapid evolution and variation of COVID-19 are influenced by its transmission dynamics, which can be described as its diffusibility . The transmission from infectious to susceptible hosts depends on contact rates among individuals and the probability that contacts result in transmission [6, 7]. This is an important concept in disease control as it tries to describe the disease's pattern and how the implementation of public health measures can contain its spread , reducing the number of contacts and thus reducing the transmission rate ."
PMC8250298,2021-03-23,Nonlinear modulation of COVID‐19 transmission by climate conditions,"COVID‐19 is spreading rapidly worldwide, posing great threats to public health and economy. This study aims to examine how the transmission of COVID‐19 is modulated by climate conditions, which is of great importance for better understanding of the seasonal feature of COVID‐19. Constrained by the accurate observations we can make, the basic reproduction numbers (R ) for each country were inferred and linked to temperature and relative humidity (RH) with statistical analysis. Using R  as the measure of COVID‐19 transmission potential, we find stronger transmission of COVID‐19 under mildly warm (0°C < T < 20°C) and humid (RH > 60%) climate conditions, while extremely low (T < −2°C) and high (T > 20°C) temperature or a dry climate (RH < 60%) weakens transmission. The established nonlinear relationships between COVID‐19 transmission and climate conditions suggest that seasonal climate variability may affect the spread and severity of COVID‐19 infection, and temperate coastal regions with mildly warm and humid climate would be susceptible to large‐scale outbreaks.","A severe respiratory disease, identified later as the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19) caused by SARS‐CoV‐2 virus, was reported in Wuhan, Hubei province, China, in December 2019 (Wu et al., 2020). Since then, it has quickly spread around the world. As of June 29, 2020, over 10 million infections have been confirmed worldwide and over 500,000 people have died from the infection (JHU, 2020). COVID‐19 is characterized with notable ability to spread given that there is no effective vaccine and treatment to date. The transmission of COVID‐19 is thought to occur through inhalation of droplets containing virus or through touching infected surfaces and then being infected via mouth, eyes or nose (Qu et al., 2020). The survival of virus in droplets and on infected surfaces or other medium can be largely affected by environmental conditions. An environmental study of SARS‐CoV‐1 found reduced survival of the virus at higher temperature and humidity (Chan et al., 2011). Several human coronaviruses (HCoV‐HKU1, HCoV‐OC43 etc.) also exhibit strong winter seasonality and become undetectable in summer months in temperate regions (Gaunt et al., 2010). Given the similarity between SARS‐CoV‐1 and other coronaviruses (SARS‐CoV‐2, HCoV‐HKU1, HCoV‐OC43 etc.), the spread of COVID‐19 might also be influenced by climate conditions."
PMC8264784,2021-06-24,"Estimation of the Basic Reproduction Numbers of the Subtypes H5N1, H5N8, and H5N6 During the Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza Epidemic Spread Between Farms","It is important to understand pathogen transmissibility in a population to establish an effective disease prevention policy. The basic reproduction number (R) is an epidemiologic parameter for understanding the characterization of disease and its dynamics in a population. We aimed to estimate the R of the highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) subtypes H5N1, H5N8, and H5N6, which were associated with nine outbreaks in Korea between 2003 and 2018, to understand the epidemic transmission of each subtype. According to HPAI outbreak reports of the Animal and Plant Quarantine Agency, we estimated the generation time by calculating the time of infection between confirmed HPAI-positive farms. We constructed exponential growth and maximum likelihood (ML) models to estimate the basic reproduction number, which assumes the number of secondary cases infected by the index case. The Kruskal-Wallis test was used to analyze the epidemic statistics between subtypes. The estimated generation time of H5N1, H5N8, and H5N6 were 4.80 days [95% confidence interval (CI) 4.23–5.38] days, 7.58 (95% CI 6.63–8.46), and 5.09 days (95% CI 4.44–5.74), respectively. A pairwise comparison showed that the generation time of H5N8 was significantly longer than that of the subtype H5N1 (P = 0.04). Based on the ML model, R was estimated as 1.69 (95% CI 1.48–2.39) for subtype H5N1, 1.60 (95%CI 0.97–2.23) for subtype H5N8, and 1.49 (95%CI 0.94–2.04) for subtype H5N6. We concluded that R estimates may be associated with the poultry product system, climate, species specificity based on the HPAI virus subtype, and prevention policy. This study provides an insight on the transmission and dynamics patterns of various subtypes of HPAI occurring worldwide. Furthermore, the results are useful as scientific evidence for establishing a disease control policy.","Highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) is a highly contagious viral disease that infects domestic poultry and wild birds . The HPAI virus can cause an epidemic that may spread rapidly, has a high mortality rate among domestic birds, and devastates the poultry industry . Outbreaks of distinct subtypes of HPAI, including H5N1, H5N8, and H5N6, are continually reported worldwide (3–5), and this global HPAI virus dissemination is caused by migratory wild birds . The HPAI crisis appears to be a great threat to not only animal health but also public health worldwide. Furthermore, the World Health Organization reported 860 human infection cases of avian influenza A subtype H5N1  after the first human case of HPAI subtype H5N1, which was reported in Hong Kong in 1997 . In South Korea, outbreaks of three different subtypes of HPAI occurred between 2003 and 2018. The first outbreak of H5N1 occurred from December 2003 to February 2004 and had a high mortality rate at poultry farms, especially among chickens . Since then, outbreaks of H5N1 have occurred in 2006, 2008, and 2010 (10–12). The novel HPAI subtype, H5N8, was first reported in January 2014 at South Korean poultry farms . Genetic analyses of viruses isolated from wild birds and poultry farms showed that migratory birds could be responsible for the first wave of H5N8 outbreaks between January and May 2014 . After the first wave, two waves of subtype H5N8 occurred during September 2014 to June 2015 and during September 2015 to November 2015 . It was reported that these sporadic outbreaks were caused by viruses reintroduced into Korea by migratory waterfowl . In November 2016, a novel genotype of H5N6 that was first detected in wild birds in Korea and HPAI infectious cases was reported at poultry farms . Another novel H5N8 virus co-circulated with H5N6 virus during the outbreaks in 2016, from February to June 2017 . In November 2017, the novel H5N6 virus was detected at a broiler duck farm and in wild mallards, with infection spreading to poultry farms ."
PMC8386157,2021-08-25,"Simulating an invasion: unsealed water storage (rainwater tanks) and urban block design facilitate the spread of the dengue fever mosquito, Aedes aegypti, in Brisbane, Australia","Aedes aegypti (Linnaeus) was once highly prevalent across eastern Australia, resulting in epidemics of dengue fever. Drought conditions have led to a rapid rise in semi-permanent, urban water storage containers called rainwater tanks known to be critical larval habitat for the species. The presence of these larval habitats has increased the risk of establishment of highly urbanised, invasive mosquito vectors such as Ae. aegypti. Here we use a spatially explicit network model to examine the role that unsealed rainwater tanks may play in population connectivity of an Ae. aegypti invasion in suburbs of Brisbane, a major Australian city. We characterise movement between rainwater tanks as a diffusion-like process, limited by a maximum distance of movement, average life expectancy, and a probability that Ae. aegypti will cross wide open spaces such as roads. The simulation model was run against a number of scenarios that examined population spread through the rainwater tank network based on non-compliance rates of tanks (unsealed or sealed) and road grids. We show that Ae. aegypti tank infestation and population spread was greatest in areas of high tank density and road lengths were shortest e.g. cul-de-sacs. Rainwater tank non-compliance rates of over 30% show increased connectivity when compared to less than 10%, suggesting rainwater tanks non-compliance should be maintained under this level to minimize the spread of an invading Ae. aegypti population. These results presented as risk maps of Ae. aegypti spread across Brisbane, can assist health and government authorities on where to optimally target rainwater tank surveillance and educational activities. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION The online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s10530-021-02619-z.","Large epidemics of dengue historically plagued the east coast of Australia, where an estimated 70–90% of the human population were infected (Lumley and Taylor 1943). It has been suggested that large water storage containers, called rainwater tanks, maintained Aedes aegypti (Linnaeus) populations responsible for these epidemics (Hamlyn-Harris 1931; Lumley and Taylor 1943). The removal of rainwater tanks from major urban environments is thought to have contributed to the disappearance of the species from sub-tropical locations (Russell et al. 2009; Trewin et al. 2017). However, drought conditions in the early 2000s and subsequent government incentives, saw a rapid rise in the number of rainwater tanks reinstalled throughout all major Australian cities. It is estimated that there are now ~ 300,000 rainwater tanks in the south-east Queensland region, representing nearly 40% of residential dwellings (Moglia et al. 2013). When unsealed or ‘non-compliant’ with regulations, rainwater tanks are ideal habitat for all life-cycle stages of Ae. aegypti and have the potential to act as a major population source for disease vectors (Trewin et al. 2020; Tun-Lin et al. 1995). Rainwater tanks provide all the requirements for development of the species; reliable larval food resources, ideal temperature range and humidity, a surface for oviposition and resting, a permanent or semi-permanent source of water where larval density is unlikely to be restricted and close proximity to human hosts (Trewin 2018). The rapid rise of these permanent water storage containers has led to an increased risk of the re-establishment of Ae. aegypti in Brisbane, the largest urban centre in Queensland, Australia (Heersink et al. 2015; Trewin 2018; Trewin et al. 2013). Population connectivity is an important ecological process that underpins the ability of an organism to persist and spread within a landscape (Fahrig and Merriam 1985). Connectivity is best defined as the capacity of a landscape to facilitate or impede the movement of organisms between resource patches (Taylor et al. 1993). Therefore, persistence and spread of a newly established organism can be influenced by movement patterns and mortality as a function of landscape structure (Ferrari et al. 2007). In medically important species such Ae. aegypti, an understanding of landscape connectivity guides vector management practices (State of Queensland 2015) or optimizes ‘rear and release’ strategies such as population replacement (Hoffmann et al. 2011) or the sterile insect technique (Dyck et al. 2006). For instance, the removal of larval sources, a tenet of mosquito control for decades, aims to suppress or eliminate a population by removing key habitat resources within a landscape (Gorgas 1915; Gubler and Clark 1994; Trewin et al. 2017). In this way connectivity between resource patches is disrupted, lowering population spread and abundance, the probability of persistence and the prevention of disease transmission. A better understanding of Ae. aegypti population spread, limited by the spatial distribution of resource abundance, could lead to improved control programs and strategies for achieving elimination."
PMC8403470,2021-08-29,The association between initial COVID-19 spread and meteorological factors in Indonesia,"On March 2, 2020, the first Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) case was reported in Jakarta, Indonesia. One and a half months later (15/05/2020), the cumulative number of infection cases was 16,496, with a total of 1076 mortalities. This study investigates the possible role of weather in the early cases of COVID-19 in six selected cities in Indonesia. Daily temperature and relative humidity data from weather stations nearby in each city were collected from March 3 to April 30, 2020, corresponding with COVID-19 incidence. Correlation tests and regression analysis were performed to examine the association of those two data series. Moreover, we analyzed the distribution of COVID-19 referring the weather data to estimate the effective range of weather data supporting the COVID-19 incidence. Our result reveals that weather data is generally associated with COVID-19 incidence. The daily average temperature (T-ave) and relative humidity (RH) present significant positive and negative correlation with COVID-19 data, respectively. However, the correlation coefficients are weak, with the strongest correlations found at the 5-day lag, i.e., 0.37 (− 0.41) for T-ave (RH). The regression analysis consistently confirmed this relation. The distribution analysis reveals that most COVID-19 cases in Indonesia occurred in the daily temperature range of 25–31 °C and relative humidity of 74–92%. Our findings suggest that COVID-19 incidence in Indonesia has a weak association with weather conditions. Therefore, non-meteorological factors seem to play a more prominent role and should be given greater consideration in preventing the spread of COVID-19.

In the mid-latitudes of the northern hemisphere countries (US, Italy, Spain, Iran, UK, Germany), the number of patients exposed to Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) increased ( data per 31 March 2020).

PMC8475859,2021-09-24,Effective Reproduction Number and Dispersion under Contact Tracing and Lockdown on COVID-19 in Karnataka,"We study the effectiveness and limitations of contact-tracing, quarantine, and lockdown measures used in India to control the spread of COVID-19 infections. Using data provided in the media bulletins of Government of Karnataka we observe that the so called [Formula see text] rule holds for secondary infections and classify them into clusters. Using a mixture of Poisson with Gamma model we establish that clusters show variation in deceased rates ([Formula see text] ), low reproduction numbers ([Formula see text] ), small dispersion([Formula see text] ), and that super-spreading events can occur. Further, migration due to relaxation in lockdown is unlikely to be the sole cause of recent surge. The methodology presented is universal in nature and can be applied whenever such precise data is available.","For COVID-19, in the absence of a vaccine, key measures to contain infection spread have been lockdowns, contact tracing, quarantine, testing along with wide publicity of social distancing norms, hygiene guidelines, awareness of the symptoms of the disease and treatment. There are many efforts to understand control measures such as lockdowns, contact tracing and quarantine with respect to COVID-19 spread using stochastic models, see for e.g. (Joel et al. 2020; Ferretti et al. 2020). Contact tracing and other control measures were also used by countries during the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) epidemic, see (Lipsitch et al. 2003; Steven et al. 2003) for a detailed analysis on control efforts and clusters initiated by “super-spread” events (SSEs) and community transmission. In Ramanan et al. , the authors study the epidemiology and transmission of COVID-19 in two states of India namely, Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh, using testing and contact-tracing data. In Lloyd-Smith James et al. , they argue that studying only the basic reproduction number can obscure the individual variation in infectiousness. Their motivation being ‘super-spreading events’ in which certain individuals had infected unusually large numbers of secondary cases (5–10 in the SARS epidemic). They studied contact tracing data from eight directly transmitted diseases, and showed that the distribution of individual infectiousness around the basic reproduction number is skewed. Using various models they then proceed to compare the effect of individual-specific control measures versus population-wide measures. They conclude that super-spreading events are a normal feature of disease spread and give a formal definition of the same."

The scheme subsidised 50% off the cost of food and non-alcoholic drinks for an unlimited number of visits in participating restaurants on Mondays–Wednesdays from 3–31 August 2020. Areas with higher take-up saw both a notable increase in new COVID-19 infection clusters within a week of the scheme starting and a deceleration in infections within two weeks of the program ending. Similarly, areas that exhibited notable rainfall during the prime lunch and dinner hours on the days the scheme was active record lower infection incidence—a pattern that is also measurable in mobility data—and non-detectable on days during which the discount was not available or for rainfall outside the core lunch and dinner hours.","I leverage data from the UK’s official COVID-19 reporting dashboard available at  This provides data on weekly COVID-19 case counts at the Middle Layer Super Output Area (MSOA) level.1 MSOAs have, on average, 8,288 residents and at least 5,000 residents as per the 2011 census. Across the study area of England there are 6,791 MSOAs. For confidentiality protection, the data suppress counts that are less than or equal to 2. Individual cases get allocated to individual MSOAs based on their residence address. Furthermore, cases get allocated to weeks based on the date on which individuals take the COVID-19 test—which, due to processing delays, can be different from the date that a test result is reported (see Fetzer and Graeber, 2020 for a related paper). The resulting dataset at the MSOA level is a balanced panel across 6,791 English MSOAs by calendar week from calendar week 5 to calendar week 40. For ease of interpretation, the primary dependent variable this paper studies is whether an MSOA reported more than two new COVID-19 cases in any given week—though all results are robust and provide similar quantitative results when using the continuous case count measures. While the dataset stretches all the way to the beginning of the year, I focus on a shorter time window around the time during which the EOHO scheme was running. All results are robust to including data from early in 2020."
PMC8626757,2021-11-27,Group size and modularity interact to shape the spread of infection and information through animal societies,"Social interactions between animals can provide many benefits, including the ability to gain useful environmental information through social learning. However, these social contacts can also facilitate the transmission of infectious diseases through a population. Animals engaging in social interactions therefore face a trade-off between the potential informational benefits and the risk of acquiring disease. Theoretical models have suggested that modular social networks, associated with the formation of groups or sub-groups, can slow spread of infection by trapping it within particular groups. However, these social structures will not necessarily impact the spread of information in the same way if its transmission follows a “complex contagion”, e.g. through individuals disproportionally copying the majority (conformist learning). Here we use simulation models to demonstrate that modular networks can promote the spread of information relative to the spread of infection, but only when the network is fragmented and group sizes are small. We show that the difference in transmission between information and disease is maximised for more well-connected social networks when the likelihood of transmission is intermediate. Our results have important implications for understanding the selective pressures operating on the social structure of animal societies, revealing that highly fragmented networks such as those formed in fission–fusion social groups and multilevel societies can be effective in modulating the infection-information trade-off for individuals within them.

These interactions frequently provide opportunity for gaining social information (Danchin et al. 2004; Laland 2004; McGregor 2005; Allen et al. 2013; Aplin et al. 2015), whether it be the location of new food sources (Aplin et al. 2012; Kendal et al. 2015; Berdahl et al. 2018; Nöbel et al. 2018) or predation risk (Beauchamp et al. 2012; Crane and Ferrari 2013; Frechette et al. 2014). However, interacting with others can also be costly, with one of the primary costs being the risk of infection with pathogens or parasites (Daszak et al. 2000; Stattner and Vidot 2011). Balancing risk of infection with the potential to gain useful information can thus be one of the key trade-offs animals face when engaging in social interactions (Evans et al. 2020; Romano et al. 2020). Although it is possible to obtain information or become infected indirectly via interactions with the physical environment (e.g. scent marking Gosling and Roberts 2001; disease reservoirs Adelman et al. 2015), many studies have shown that the spread of both infectious disease and information through a population will be strongly influenced by social interaction patterns (Aplin et al. 2012; White et al. 2017; Hoyt et al. 2018). While the transmission of infection and information may depend on different types of interactions, there is likely to be overlap depending on how the pathogen spreads between hosts and how individuals learn from each other (Evans et al. 2020). To better understand this potential trade-off between information and disease, it is necessary to quantify how different social structures can promote access to useful information while minimising risk of infection (Evans et al. 2020; Firth 2020; Romano et al. 2020). Social structures can help maximise the benefits of sociality for their members by promoting the persistence of social units and so increasing their fitness indirectly (Ilany and Akcay 2016; Kramer and Meunier 2019). As such, selection can act on behaviours because of their influence on emergent social structures in addition to their direct impact on individual fitness. Consequently, investigating which aspects of sociality slow down the spread of disease while promoting information transmission therefore represents an important contribution to our understanding of social evolution."
PMC8655713,2021-12-09,Feasibility of using infant testing during immunization to estimate HIV mother-to-child-transmission rates in Zambia," This study piloted the feasibility of infant testing in immunization services as a strategy for estimating MTCT rates among the population of HIV exposed infants at national and subnational levels in Zambia. METHODS The study recruited a cross-sectional nationally representative sample of 8042 caregiver-baby pairs in 38 high volume immunization sites in 7 towns across 3 provinces of Zambia. All mothers who brought their children below the age of one year for immunization at the study facilities were invited to participate in the study. All consenting mothers were interviewed and blood drawn from their babies for; rapid HIV antibody test to determine exposure and DNA PCR test for samples of all HIV-exposed babies to determine HIV infection. RESULTS Of 8042 recruited caregiver–baby pairs, 1409 (17.5%) babies were HIV-exposed. Approximately 90.2% of all mothers of HIV exposed infants reported that they attended ANC visits more than two times and facility based deliveries stood at 91.6%. Exclusive breastfeeding among HIV exposed infants reduced with increase in age of infant; it was highest at 6 weeks (82.2%) followed by 10 weeks (74.0%) and 14 weeks (58.2%). MTCT rates were relatively lower than what was reported before in subnational studies and stood at 4.7% among Penta 1 seekers, 2.8% among Penta 2 seekers, 2.1% among Penta 3 seekers and 5.0% among Measles vaccination seekers. The overall MTCT rate stood at 3.8%. About 48.1% of HIV positive babies were male compared to 51.9% females. Babies of mothers below the age of 25 years accounted for almost half (51.9%) of all HIV infected babies in the study. Reported exclusive breastfeeding among HIV positive babies was 77.8% for Penta 1 seekers, 75.0% for Penta 2 seekers and 100% for Penta 3 seekers. CONCLUSIONS The study succeeded in estimating the MTCT rates using infant testing in immunization services, thereby demonstrating that it is feasible to use routine infant testing in immunization services as a strategy for estimating MTCT rates among the population of HIV-exposed infants in countries with high HIV burden and immunization coverage.","Vertical transmission of Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) is the most common source of paediatric HIV infection in Zambia . In 2016, around 8900 children became newly infected with HIV in Zambia indicating a 56% decline from 20,000 new paediatric infections in 2009 [2, 3]. Mother-to-Child Transmission of HIV (MTCT) ranges from 15 to 45% in the absence of any intervention. MTCT can however be reduced to below 5% with effective interventions during pregnancy, delivery and breastfeeding. Intervention include inter alia; Antiretroviral Treatment (ART) for the HIV positive pregnant woman or mother and a short course of antiretroviral drugs for the exposed infant, facility based delivery, and appropriate breastfeeding practice [4, 5]. Zambia first introduced its rigorous Prevention of Mother-to-Child Transmission of HIV (PMTCT) programme in 1999 and has been committed to virtual elimination of MTCT since 2010 . Zambia’s prevention and treatment of HIV infection guidelines requires the testing of all women receiving Antenatal Care (ANC) and enrolment of all those that are found positive into HIV care and treatment ."
PMC8654879,2021-11-08,Marburg virus disease outbreak in Guinea: a SPIN framework of its transmission and control measures for an exemplary response pattern in West Africa,"Responding to highly infectious diseases relies on a thorough understanding of transmission epidemiology. With the recent outbreak of Marburg Virus Disease (MVD) in Guinea, we saw the need to shed some technical light based on published literature and our field experiences. We reviewed 14 previous MVD outbreaks globally. Coupled with core one - health approaches, we propose a Socio-environmental context, Possible transmission routes, Informing and guiding public health action, Needs in terms of control measures (SPIN) framework as a guiding tool for response teams to appropriately approach future infectious disease outbreaks.","Responding to highly infectious diseases which involve their prevention and control; relies on a thorough understanding of the epidemiological factors enhancing transmission . Also, minimizing the transmission of infectious diseases remains a core function of the public health principles. MVD is a highly virulent disease; caused by the Marburg virus (MARV) that was first recognized in 1967  and a recent outbreak has been established in Guinea. The reservoir host of the Marburg virus has been established to be the African fruit bat - Rousettus aegyptiacus . However, fruit bats infected with the Marburg virus do not show obvious signs of illness . Humans can become infected with the Marburg virus, and may develop serious diseases with high mortality. MVD fatality rates reported in different outbreaks ranged from 24-100% , even though the disease generally occurs at a low prevalence. Clinically, MVD causes a severe hemorrhagic fever, known as Marburg hemorrhagic fever (MHF), in both nonhuman and humans primates . It is worthy to note that, Marburg virus, is a genetically animal-borne/unique zoonotic ribonucleic acid (RNA) virus of the filovirus family (Ebola virus are the only other known members of the filovirus family). Two large outbreaks that occurred simultaneously in Marburg and Frankfurt in Germany, and Belgrade, Serbia, in 1967, led to the initial recognition of the disease . The outbreak was associated with laboratory work using African green monkeys imported from Uganda; a country prone to MVD outbreaks. After the discovery, there have been a total of 14 MVD outbreaks as seen in Table 1, most of which occurred in Africa, with a few outbreaks occurring outside Africa even though traced back to Africa . The history of the outbreaks guided the conception of the SPIN framework (Table 1). Taking a summary look at Table 1, the transmission dynamics of MARV is such that, source of infection includes errors in laboratory experiments for example during the MVD outbreak in Germany and Yugoslavia simultaneously, when laboratory workers experimenting on grivets (African savanna green monkey) imported from Uganda were infected with MARV after handling tissues/organs of these monkeys. Also, other cases were reported due to nosocomial transmission, and retrospectively, a woman who got infected with MVD, 3 months earlier via sexual contact with her husband. Other major outbreaks occurred as a result of tourism (for example holiday safari in Uganda, where activities included visiting local and viewing wildlife in villages and camping), working in mines, hunting around caves harboring enormous populations of the Egyptian fruit bats."
PMC8697311,2021-11-02,"Transmission pattern of shigellosis in Wuhan City, China: a modelling study","The article aims to estimate and forecast the transmissibility of shigellosis and explore the association of meteorological factors with shigellosis. The mathematical model named Susceptible–Exposed–Symptomatic/Asymptomatic–Recovered–Water/Food (SEIARW) was used to explore the feature of shigellosis transmission based on the data of Wuhan City, China, from 2005 to 2017. The study applied effective reproduction number (R(eff)) to estimate the transmissibility. Daily meteorological data from 2008 to 2017 were used to determine Spearman's correlation with reported new cases and R(eff). The SEIARW model fit the data well (χ = 0.00046, p > 0.999). The simulation results showed that the reservoir-to-person transmission of the shigellosis route has been interrupted. The R(eff) would be reduced to a transmission threshold of 1.00 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.82–1.19) in 2035. Reducing the infectious period to 11.25 days would also decrease the value of R(eff) to 0.99. There was a significant correlation between new cases of shigellosis and atmospheric pressure, temperature, wind speed and sun hours per day. The correlation coefficients, although statistically significant, were very low (<0.3). In Wuhan, China, the main transmission pattern of shigellosis is person-to-person. Meteorological factors, especially daily atmospheric pressure and temperature, may influence the epidemic of shigellosis.","In 1892, dysentery was described as ‘one of the four great epidemic diseases of the world’ by the eminent physician William Osler . Shigellosis (or bacterial dysentery) caused by shigella is an acute intestinal infectious disease that often occurs in summer and autumn. High-risk groups in high-income countries include travellers and MSM (men who have sex with men), and in low- and middle-income countries include children aged 1–4 years . Shigella spp. are among the causes of diarrhoea in children . Despite reductions in morbidity and mortality of shigellosis in the past 30 years, shigellosis led to approximately 164 000 annual deaths worldwide [4, 5]. With China's rapid economic growth, the disease once associated with poverty is becoming a chronic illness . Economic level directly influences the incidence of shigellosis . In China, shigellosis incidence dropped by 46.29% from 2005 to 2010, but the disease burden was not evenly distributed . Although the water and sanitation infrastructure has improved in China, the usage of safe water and proper sanitation varies widely across the country . From 2006 to 2011, Wuhan City reported 36 487 bacillary dysentery cases, with a mean annual incidence of 77.4 per 100 000 population (ranging from 68.9 to 81.5 per 100 000) . Furthermore, the reported incidence varies in Anhui Province, Sichuan Province and Baise City [3, 7, 8]. A relatively high disease burden was found in Wuhan City compared to Chinese average level [9, 10]."
PMC8727367,2021-12-22,Modeling COVID-19 Transmission Dynamics With Self-Learning Population Behavioral Change,"Many regions observed recurrent outbreaks of COVID-19 cases after relaxing social distancing measures. It suggests that maintaining sufficient social distancing is important for limiting the spread of COVID-19. The change of population behavior responding to the social distancing measures becomes an important factor for the pandemic prediction. In this paper, we develop a SEAIR model for studying the dynamics of COVID-19 transmission with population behavioral change. In our model, the population is divided into several groups with their own social behavior in response to the delayed information about the number of the infected population. The transmission rate depends on the behavioral changes of all the population groups, forming a feedback loop to affect the COVID-19 dynamics. Based on the data of Hong Kong, our simulations demonstrate how the perceived cost after infection and the information delay affect the level and the time period of the COVID-19 waves.","Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by a newly discovered coronavirus known as SARS-CoV-2 . According to the report of WHO in April 2021, over 132 million people were reported to be infected with COVID-19 and there were over 2.8 million deaths . As such, COVID-19 has been declared as a public health emergency of international concern on July 30, 2020. Since the beginning of the pandemic, many efforts were put into predicting the disease dynamics and suggesting optimal disease control strategies. Mathematical modeling is a major tool for COVID-19 prediction, for example using SIR (susceptible-infected-recovered) or SEIR (susceptible-exposed-infected-recovered) model to describe the dynamics of COVID-19 (3–5). Different variations of the SIR model were also studied, such as COVID-19 network models (6, 7) and a model with spatial impact on COVID-19 transmission . Recurrent outbreaks of COVID-19 cases were observed in many locations. The existence of asymptomatic patients and the change of population behavior responding to the social distancing measures may be the factors for these recurrent outbreaks. Asymptomatic patients are individuals who are infectious but are not reported and show no symptoms. Because of the unawareness of infection status, asymptomatic infectious is not defined in SIR models. Recent research showed that the incubation period of COVID-19 could be as long as 12 days while the latent period is about 4 days . This result emphasizes the importance of the consideration of asymptomatic patients. For including the COVID-19 transmission with asymptomatic patients, some recent studies (10, 11) considered the extension of SIR model to SAIR model, incorporating a new compartment for asymptomatic patients."
PMC8740632,2021-12-23,Genetic Drift Versus Climate Region Spreading Dynamics of COVID-19," The current propagation models of COVID-19 are poorly consistent with existing epidemiological data and with evidence that the SARS-CoV-2 genome is mutating, for potential aggressive evolution of the disease. Objectives We looked for fundamental variables that were missing from current analyses. Among them were regional climate heterogeneity, viral evolution processes versus founder effects, and large-scale virus containment measures. Methods We challenged regional versus genetic evolution models of COVID-19 at a whole-population level, over 168,089 laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection cases in Italy, Spain, and Scandinavia at early time-points of the pandemic. Diffusion data in Germany, France, and the United Kingdom provided a validation dataset of 210,239 additional cases. Results Mean doubling time of COVID-19 cases was 6.63 days in Northern versus 5.38 days in Southern Italy. Spain extended this trend of faster diffusion in Southern Europe, with a doubling time of 4.2 days. Slower doubling times were observed in Sweden (9.4 days), Finland (10.8 days), and Norway (12.95 days). COVID-19 doubling time in Germany (7.0 days), France (7.5 days), and the United Kingdom (7.2 days) supported the North/South gradient model. Clusters of SARS-CoV-2 mutations upon sequential diffusion were not found to clearly correlate with regional distribution dynamics. Conclusion Acquisition of mutations upon SARS-CoV-2 spreading failed to explain regional diffusion heterogeneity at early pandemic times. Our findings indicate that COVID-19 transmission rates are rather associated with a sharp North/South climate gradient, with faster spreading in Southern regions. Thus, warmer climate conditions may not limit SARS-CoV-2 infectivity. Very cold regions may be better spared by recurrent courses of SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Studies on early dynamics of COVID-19 (Li et al., 2020a) revealed that the epidemic doubled in size every 6.4 (Wu et al., 2020) to 7.4 (Li et al., 2020a) days, with a reproductive number (R0) of infectious cases of 2.2 (Li et al., 2020a) to 2.7 (Wu et al., 2020). Later investigations followed disease spreading to Singapore (Pung et al., 2020), Germany (Hoehl et al., 2020), France, and Finland (www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/covid-19-pandemic) (Lipsitch et al., 2020; McMichael et al., 2020; Sun et al., 2020). However, major uncertainties remained on SARS-CoV-2 transmission dynamics (Lipsitch et al., 2020). Considerable effort across major research institutions was invested into modeling SARS-CoV-2 spreading determinants. Models were generated, which took into account, among others, global traveling, population density, demographic characteristics, age distribution, social dynamics, governmental policies, air pollution, virus infectious capacity, and SARS-CoV-2 containment procedures, together with economical and healthcare factors (Baker et al., 2020; Hernandez-Vargas and Velasco-Hernandez, 2020; Kennedy et al., 2020; Kissler et al., 2020; Lipsitch et al., 2020; Pearson et al., 2020) (10.21203/rs.3.rs-82122/v1). However, limited, if any, regional heterogeneity in COVID-19 transmission could be identified using such diffusion models. We reasoned that fundamental variables were missing from current analyses, and we went on to identify such missing factor(s). SARS-CoV-2 was suggested to be sensitive to temperature and humidity, which may affect diffusion across diverse climate areas (Sundell et al., 2016) (papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3550308; ssrn.com/abstract=3556998; www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.02.22.20025791v1). Accordingly, initial climate-dependent propagation models predicted a limited impact of COVID-19 in the Southern hemisphere, during seasons that were infection-prone in the Northern hemisphere (papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3550308; ssrn.com/abstract=3556998). However, early foci of infection were detected in Australia and New Zealand (Figure 1). Outbreaks were also revealed in South America and extended to Central America and Mexico. Further infection foci were revealed in Saudi Arabia and Africa and extended to sub-Saharan countries (Supplementary Tables S1, S2), questioning simple models of cold-climate-dependent SARS-CoV-2 transmission."
PMC8743225,2022-01-03,How much do smear-negative patients really contribute to tuberculosis transmissions? Re-examining an old question with new tools," Sputum smear microscopy is a common surrogate for tuberculosis infectiousness. Previous estimates that smear-negative patients contribute 13–20% of transmissions and are, on average, 20 to 25% as infectious as smear-positive cases are understood to be high. Herein, we use an ideal real-world setting, a comprehensive dataset, and new high-resolution techniques to more accurately estimate the true transmission risk of smear-negative cases. METHODS We treated all adult culture-positive pulmonary TB patients diagnosed in the province of Alberta, Canada from 2003 to 2016 as potential transmitters. The primary data sources were the Alberta TB Registry and the Provincial Laboratory for Public Health. We measured, as primary outcomes, the proportion of transmissions attributable to smear-negative sources and the relative transmission rate. First, we replicated previous studies by using molecular (DNA) fingerprint clustering. Then, using a prospectively collected registry of TB contacts, we defined transmission events as active TB amongst identified contacts who either had a 100% DNA fingerprint match to the source case or a clinical diagnosis. We supplemented our analysis with genome sequencing on temporally and geographically linked DNA fingerprint clusters of cases not identified as contacts. FINDINGS There were 1176 cases, 563 smear-negative and 613 smear-positive, and 23,131 contacts. Replicating previous studies, the proportion of transmissions attributable to smear-negative source cases was 16% (95% CI, 12–19%) and the relative transmission rate was 0.19 (95% CI, 0.14–0.26). With our combined approach, the proportion of transmission was 8% (95% CI, 3–14%) and the relative transmission rate became 0.10 (95% CI, 0.05–0.19). INTERPRETATION When we examined the same outcomes as in previous studies but refined transmission ascertainment with the addition of conventional epidemiology and genomics, we found that smear-negative cases were ∼50% less infectious than previously thought. FUNDING Alberta Innovates Health Solutions","Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, globally, tuberculosis (TB) was the number one infectious disease cause of death. With 10 million new cases and 1.45 million deaths annually, TB has appropriately, albeit belatedly, become the focus of high-level commitments and concerted elimination efforts.1 However, while TB elimination requires an end to transmission, there are still many unanswered questions about the transmission of TB.2 The number of infectious droplet nuclei per volume of air3 determines TB infectiousness. Varying patient, pathogen, and environmental factors can create the requisite conditions for a transmission. In terms of patient-level factors, infectiousness of a person with TB depends on disease type (laryngeal vs pulmonary vs extra-pulmonary), radiographic findings, symptomology (most notably cough), delays in diagnosis, treatment characteristics, and, importantly, sputum smear-status.3"
PMC8747866,2022-01-11,MANIFESTO: a huMAN-centric explaInable approach for FakE news spreaders deTectiOn,"Fake news spreading is strongly connected with the human involvement as individuals tend to fall, adopt and circulate misinformation stories. Until recently, the role of human characteristics in fake news diffusion, in order to deeply understand and fight misinformation patterns, has not been explored to the full extent. This paper suggests a human-centric approach on detecting fake news spreading behavior by building an explainable fake-news-spreader classifier based on psychological and behavioral cues of individuals. Our model achieves promising classification results while offering explanations of human motives and features behind fake news spreading behavior. Moreover, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first study that aims at providing a fully explainable setup that evaluates fake news spreading based on users credibility applied to public discussions aiming to a comprehensive way to combat fake news through human involvement.","With the sharp rise of social networks, users are able to access, share, and discuss on almost any kind of online circulated content. The ease and comfort of online social networks (OSNs), encourages individuals to turn on OSNs platforms as the major point for news seeking, updating, discussing, etc . However, lurking in the shadows of OSNs lies a vast amount of deception, misinformation and disinformation cases. These cases have established the familiar term fake news . Unfortunately, OSNs stand out as main sources at which misinformation is spread and platforms, like the popular Twitter, have become the most used fora at which fake news stories exist and thrive. Human ethics and democratic views are at risk since even presidential elections are manipulated  , and critical health decisions (e.g. covid pandemic fake stories) are blended with dark conspiracy theories1  . Data science and AI research should dynamically act on these phenomena with robust methods and techniques which will detect and block OSNs misinformation spreading. The vast majority of the literature has so far detected misinformation at a post-level exploration, tagging of a specific piece of information as a fake news content  [2, 20, 36, 39, 44, 53, 55]. On the contrary, users tendency to circulate misinformation has only recently gained attention. Recent work has explored the role of people in misinformation spreading highlighting the role of users’ profiles. Other studies have focused on user profile characteristics such as gender, personality, users’ psycho-linguistic features or, in other words, language use that reflects psychological aspects, as well as sentiment and emotions which are expressed in a user’s text  [17, 48, 50] correlated with the probability of being a fake news spreader. Therefore, the human role is doubly crucial on fake news challenge both in terms of acting as a fake news spreader and being exposed to fake news content."
PMC8799455,2022-01-29,Trade networks and shock transmission capacity: a new taxonomy of Italian industries,"Applying the social network analysis to domestic and international input–output tables, we position the Italian sectors within their trade networks to analyze their ability to transmit economic shocks within the economic system. In this context, we propose a new taxonomy that classifies sectors in terms of the extent to, and the speed at, which they tend to spread domestic and foreign impulses throughout the Italian economic system. Our results show a mismatch between the industries which have a central position within international trade network and industries which play a central role for the domestic propagation of shocks. In this vein, the capacity of transmitting stimuli from abroad is limited, weakening the possibility to benefit from positive shocks, even though it could partially provide a shelter from negative one in the international business cycle.","Trade networks represent a relevant vehicle for the transmission of economic shocks. The structure of inter-sectoral relationships contributes to determine how factors such as productivity dynamics, technological progress, increase or decrease in demand can affect the business system through trade relationships along supply-chains. Furthermore, transmission also operates at an international level, through the links connecting a country’s exporting (importing) sectors to foreign importing (exporting) industries. In the last decades, these factors have increased their importance, as the international interconnectedness across sectors has risen and the relevance of international trade has increased with growing participation in global value chains (GVCs). However, the extent and speed of transmission can be heterogeneous between and within countries industries and firms can be more or less central in trade networks. In this context, a mismatch may emerge between sectors that are central for the international transmission of shocks and those that are central for their domestic propagation. In other words, a sector could be strongly connected with other foreign sectors, so representing a potential transmission channel for exogenous shocks; however, if it is not central within the domestic trade network, its ability to transmit shocks into the domestic economy would be weak. Conversely, a sector with little or no foreign trade links could be central within the domestic trade network; in such a case, a shock originating in that sector could spread widely and rapidly across the domestic economy but with little impact on foreign markets."
PMC8810288,2022-02-03,"Analysis of deterministic models for dengue disease transmission dynamics with vaccination perspective in Johor, Malaysia","Dengue is a mosquito-borne disease which has continued to be a public health issue in Malaysia. This paper investigates the impact of singular use of vaccination and its combined effort with treatment and adulticide controls on the population dynamics of dengue in Johor, Malaysia. In a first step, a compartmental model capturing vaccination compartment with mass random vaccination distribution process is appropriately formulated. The model with or without imperfect vaccination exhibits backward bifurcation phenomenon. Using the available data and facts from the 2012 dengue outbreak in Johor, basic reproduction number for the outbreak is estimated. Sensitivity analysis is performed to investigate how the model parameters influence dengue disease transmission and spread in a population. In a second step, a new deterministic model incorporating vaccination as a control parameter of distinct constant rates with the efforts of treatment and adulticide controls is developed. Numerical simulations are carried out to evaluate the impact of the three control measures by implementing several control strategies. It is observed that the transmission of dengue can be curtailed using any of the control strategies analysed in this work. Efficiency analysis further reveals that a strategy that combines vaccination, treatment and adulticide controls is most efficient for dengue prevention and control in Johor, Malaysia.","Dengue Fever (DF) is the most rapidly emerging mosquito-borne viral infection worldwide [1, 2]. The disease is a major public health concern throughout tropical and sub-tropical regions of the world [1, 3, 4], in more than 100 countries in South-East Asia, the Western Pacific and South and Central America . Nowadays, dengue is endemic in most tropical and sub-tropical areas of the globe , and its transmission has increased predominantly in urban and semi-urban areas recently . Up to 2.5 billion people worldwide live under the threat of DF and its severe forms–Dengue Haemorrhagic Fever (DHF) or Dengue Shock Syndrome (DSS) . The World Health Organisation (WHO) estimated that, annually, 9 million symptomatic cases and 0.5 million severe episodes of dengue occur globally . Moreover, while dengue is a worldwide health issue, with a consistent increment in the number of nations announcing the disease, presently near 75% of the worldwide population at dengue risk are in Asia-Pacific region . Since the 1950s, dengue has become a serious health issue in South-East Asia region . In recent decades, DHF has become a significant reason for hospitalisations and deaths among children in the greater part of the Asian countries , including Malaysia. In Malaysia, dissemination of dengue cases vary considerably among states and districts where dengue cases are more pronounced in urban and suburban areas [7, 8]. The first dengue outbreak in Malaysia occurred in 1902. Since then, the nation has progressively well-known for ceaseless dengue endemic cases as a result of the continual increase in reported cases of DF ."
PMC8857639,2022-02-19,Pattern Formation in Epidemic Model with Media Coverage,"In this article, a spatial epidemic model with media coverage is studied. By both mathematical analysis and numerical simulation, we found that there are some typical dynamics of population density such as the formation of the hole, stripe, spot, coexistence of hole and stripe or spot and stripe. The obtained results exhibit that parameters describing media coverage have a significant influence on the spatial pattern of the disease. More specifically, the sequential change in behaviour of the spatial pattern is observed as the parameter that accounts for media coverage increases. These changes analogous to the effect due to the rise in the basic reproduction number. The results presented in this article thus can be applied to any particular disease with some modification to study the effects of media coverage on disease dynamics. The model is although simple but the idea can be well extended to other complex problems.","Around 12,000 years ago, when our ancestors left their nomadic hunter-gatherer society and formed the agricultural society, along with other consequences, they brought epidemics caused by viruses, and we are still fighting against the epidemic. Despite the recent development of science and technology, the epidemic diseases are still a threat to human’s health. To control the epidemic, we need to understand the dynamics of diseases. The classical models describing the dynamics of infectious diseases involves interaction between susceptible and infective. However, there are numerous environmental factors, such as vaccination, media coverage, migration of population etc. which can also regulate the spread of infectious diseases and can play a vital role in preventing the epidemic. Due to the recent progress of information technology, media has been used effectively as a disease control method for many infectious diseases such as H1N1, HIV/AIDS, SARS, EVD. The WHO has indicated the active role of media by rapid sharing of information in controlling the spread of H7N9 in China in 2013 . The local outbreak of Zika virus in Latin America did not evolve into a global epidemic as it came into the comprehensive public view through mass media in 2016. The media such as TV News, Radio, Newspapers etc. aware the public about hazard caused from the infectious diseases and also inform them about valuable pieces of information like vaccination, avoidance of congregated places, wearing protective masks. Therefore the effective use of media may reduce the severity of a disease outbreak [3, 11, 12, 18]."
PMC8915157,2022-03-11,Spillovers from one country’s sovereign debt to CDS (credit default swap) spreads of others during the European crisis: a spatial approach,This paper examines the interactions among CDS spreads across 13 European countries using spatial econometrics techniques. Our model allows for the estimation of direct and indirect transmission of sovereign risk and feedback effects across the network of these countries. The novelty of this paper is to link macroeconomic variables and CDS spreads in a new context of analysis to uncover new channels affecting sovereign risk across countries during the European debt crisis. We show that the key channel in driving sovereign risk spillovers is trade linkages between the countries. Our results also reveal that a country’s CDS spread is approximately 7 basis points (bps) higher for a 1% increase in public debt-to-GDP levels while that increase in indebtedness is associated with roughly 2 bps higher spreads in all other countries.,"The debt crisis in Europe tested the fiscal fragility of the currency union for the first time in its more than a decade long history.

No one can assess what consequences would arise for the German economy, on Italy, Spain, and the Eurozone as a whole and finally for the whole world,” [while] “…protestors gathered outside the Bundestag… [and]… while Germany’s best-selling newspaper, Bild, a populist tabloid, splashed with the headline ‘Billions for Greece—Stop’” and called for politicians not to “go any further down this crazy path.”1 If there were spillovers from Greek debt to German sovereign risk however the German Chancellor, Angela Merkel, would be justified in her comments. This study aims to examine the impact of the level of government debt in a European country on the CDS spreads of other European countries. We investigate 13 European countries from 2008-Q1 to 2012-Q1 for this purpose. This period comprises the subprime crisis in the United States that triggered the crisis in Europe which escalated to several countries and culminated in 2012 with Greece’s default on its sovereign debt. The European crisis focused attention on the heterogeneity of the European economies, especially those in the Eurozone and outside. For example, Sweden, the United Kingdom (UK), and Denmark are not in the Eurozone but are in the European Union (EU). These countries have stable economies that are similar to core Eurozone countries such as Germany, France, Austria, Belgium, and the Netherlands. The periphery countries in the Eurozone such as Greece, Ireland, Portugal, Spain, and Italy (GIPSI) all faced unique challenges during the crisis in adjusting their indebtedness and economic fundamentals. Beside the country specific policies, the European Central Bank (ECB) also played an important role in stabilizing the financial imbalances from the beginning of the crisis. In response to the sovereign debt crisis, ECB implemented a series of conventional monetary policy measures, such as cuts in policy interest rate and minimum reserve requirements and unconventional policy measures, such as Securities Market Programme (SMP) and Outright Monetary Transactions (OMT) (Korus 2019).2"
PMC8915764,2022-03-11,The spread of informal governance practices in G-summitry,"This article examines the spread of informal practices from the G7 to the G20, analysing the implications of the G20’s adoption of six practices that have marked the G7 as a quintessential informal governance group. Drawing on archival documents, elite interviews, and embedded participant observation, the argument is made that the practices that are strengths of the G7 are liabilities for the G20. Key practices that have been central to the G7’s success do not entail success in G20. Furthermore, the practices that transpose well into the G20 context are those that have less to do with the way the members relate to one another within the club and more to do with how its members are positioned within the international system overall. These findings add complexity to the proposition that informal governance institutions like the G20 can serve as effective means to channel rising states’ status concerns.","In 1975 French President Valéry Giscard hosted the first summit that would evolve into the G7, welcoming the leaders of the USA, UK, Japan, West Germany, and Italy to Chateau Ramouillet (Canada would not be added to the club until the following year). That first meeting set the foundations that would typify G-summitry thereafter and it was of prime importance to Giscard that it be an intimate gathering, ideally with the leaders alone meeting without their usual entourages (UK Foreign and Commonwealth Office 1975). Giscard used another informal club, what was colloquially known as ‘The Library Group’, as his template for the summit. Before assuming the Presidency, Giscard had been Finance Minister and was actively involved in IMF reform during the early-1970s as the institution tried to confront the multiple financial shocks at the time, as well as its own institutional shortcomings, which were made all the more apparent by upheaval in the financial system. To overcome deadlock at the IMF, the American Treasury Secretary, George Shultz, met privately in advance of meetings with allied finance ministers from the UK, France, Japan, and West Germany to share with them what he would say in the meeting, ensure alignment, and set a plan for how to overcome any potential impasses (Naylor 2019; Shultz 2012). It was a gambit that worked sufficiently well such that it became a routine practice and the ministers began informally meeting together as a group in advance of the larger IMF meetings. It was when they did so in the library of the White House at the invitation of Nixon that they adopted their moniker (Naylor 2019; Shultz 2012)."
PMC8938227,2022-03-21,"Host and geographic barriers shape the competition, coexistence, and extinction patterns of influenza A (H1N1) viruses","The influenza virus mutates and spreads rapidly, making it suitable for studying evolutionary and ecological processes. The ecological factors and processes by which different lineages of influenza compete or coexist within hosts through time and across geographical space are poorly known. We hypothesized that competition would be stronger for influenza viruses infecting the same host compared to different hosts (the Host Barrier Hypothesis), and for those with a higher cross‐region transmission intensity (the Geographic Barrier Hypothesis). Using available sequences of the influenza A (H1N1) virus in GenBank, we identified six lineages, twelve clades, and several replacement events. We found that human‐hosted lineages had a higher cross‐region transmission intensity than swine‐hosted lineages. Co‐occurrence probabilities of lineages infecting the same host were lower than those infecting different hosts, and human‐hosted lineages had lower co‐occurrence probabilities and genetic diversity than swine‐hosted lineages. These results show that H1N1 lineages infecting the same host or with high cross‐region transmission rates experienced stronger competition and extinction pressures than those infecting different hosts or with low cross‐region transmission. Our study highlights how host and geographic barriers shape the competition, extinction, and coexistence patterns of H1N1 lineages and clades.","Influenza A virus (IAV) is one of the most common pathogens worldwide and has caused massive damage to poultry production and human health for centuries (Morens & Taubenberger, 2011; Saunders‐Hastings & Krewski, 2016). The 1918 influenza pandemic (i.e., Spanish flu) and 2009 swine flu pandemic (pdm09) were caused by the H1N1 virus, accounting for more than 40 million deaths (Krammer et al., 2018; Palese et al., 2006). The IAV genome has eight single‐stranded RNA fragments, which cause IAV to mutate rapidly (Neumann et al., 2009; Webster et al., 1992). H1N1 is an RNA virus that mutates quickly, with an overall mutation rate of about 1.8 × 10−4 s/n/r (substitutions per nucleotide per strand copied; Pauly et al., 2017). As a consequence of the high mutation rate, there are many subtypes of IAV (e.g., H1N1, H3N2), based on hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA). The H1N1 subtype IAVs have long been circulating in humans, swine, and birds. H1N1 can be categorized according to evolutionary relationships, with a strain representing virus populations with the same genome sequence, and strains with a common ancestor representing clades and lineages representing more distant common ancestry among clades. The eight segments that make up the influenza virus genome can be recombined with segments of other strains, clades, lineages, or subtypes through a process called reassortment or genetic shifts that rapidly produce new subtypes (Krammer et al., 2018). In recent decades, most outbreaks of influenza pandemics have resulted from new subtypes produced by reassortment (Kawaoka et al., 1989; Smith et al., 2009). The H1N1 virus has the longest spread history of all existing subtypes and has caused pandemics many times (Krammer et al., 2018). Thus, it is a suitable organism for studying the evolution and extinction patterns of organisms."
PMC8990284,2022-04-08,How the nature of behavior change affects the impact of asymptomatic coronavirus transmission,"SARS-CoV-2 has caused severe respiratory illnesses and deaths since late 2019 and spreads globally. While asymptomatic cases play a crucial role in transmitting COVID-19, they do not contribute to the observed prevalence, which drives behavior change during the pandemic. This study aims to identify the effect of the proportion of asymptomatic infections on the magnitude of an epidemic under behavior change scenarios by developing a compartmental mathematical model. In this interest, we discuss three different behavior change cases separately constant behavior change, instantaneous behavior change response to the disease’s perceived prevalence, and piecewise constant behavior change response to government policies. Our results imply that the proportion of asymptomatic infections which maximizes the spread of the epidemic depends on the nature of the dominant force driving behavior changes.","Beta coronavirus (\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is caused by a coronavirus called severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). It is spread through close contact from one individual to another (within about 6 feet), airborne respiratory droplets (coughs, sneezes, or talks), and aerosol transmission . A serial interval is defined to be the duration from illness onset in a primary case (infector/infective) to illness onset in a secondary case (infectee). An incubation period is defined to be the period between infection and the emergence of symptoms [5, 6]. Recent studies showed that the median serial interval for COVID-19 was estimated at 4.0 days (95% credible interval [CrI] 3.1, 4.9), and the median incubation period 5.2 days (95% confidence interval [CI], 4.1 to 7.0) [7, 8]. This difference signals that more cases may occur through pre-symptomatic transmission than through symptomatic transmission [7, 9]."
PMC9019304,2022-04-20,Effect of incubation delay and pollution on the transmission dynamics of infectious disease,"Emerging infectious diseases pose serious threat to human population. Studies suggest that there is correlation between population’s pollution status and emerging infectious diseases. We propose a delayed SIS model to examine the effects of environmental contamination on human health, which can lead to the spread of numerous diseases. A threshold parameter called basic reproduction number has been obtained for the system. Within the sight of time delay, stability analysis for equilibrium points has been obtained. The existence of Hopf bifurcation around endemic equilibrium point pertaining to time delay as a critical parameter is observed. Our study suggests that pollution can have detrimental effects on the spread of disease. Analytical results are supported by numerical simulations.","Mathematical modelling is a vital tool which has helped to analyze and manage the spread of communicable illness in populace. With the help of mathematical modelling, many researchers have been successful in predicting the effects of the spread of diseases in populace [1–7]. Different factors such as economic, geographic conditions, media coverage and so on, have a signinificant role in the transmission of these ailments [8–11]. Every country on the planet is experiencing the uncontrollable spread and effects of certain infections caused by agents such as bacteria, virus, fungi, and others, transmitted through direct or indirect contact with an infected person infected with diseases such as tuberculosis, AIDS, Dengue fever, and Covid-19, among others. The effects of these sicknesses bring about the higher rate of demise. Various strategies like vaccination, isolation, drugs and so forth, have been in regular practice by the doctors and the organizations to manage the unfold of different ailments. In spite of all the methods followed in practice, there are few diseases that are an irreplaceable part of the society, such as lifestyle diseases. Numerous models and demonstrating methods are accessible in writing [12–15] which helps us to analyze the impacts of epidemic diseases on populace. Environmental pollution continues to be a major cause of health danger around the world. Environmental pollution, which encompasses pollution of the air, water, and soil, inuences the wellbeing of the populace [11, 16–18]. In , authors studied epidemic model to study the impact of environmental pollution on spread of infectious diseases. Ecological pressure additionally harms the individuals and they tend to grow more vulnerable to certain ailments. Toxin exposure during pregnancy has an effect on newborns, making them more susceptible to illness. Poisonous synthetic substances existing in the environment as a result of increased contamination cause uncontrollable illnesses [17, 19, 20], which adds to the quick spread of epidemics. Thus, epidemic control becomes challenging for authorities, physicians, and health organizations in the modern society. We investigate a mathematical model that incorporates pollution since environmental contamination is an important aspect that cannot be overlooked while investigating disease dynamics."
PMC9123609,2022-05-21,Between everyday politics and political elites: transmission and coupling within Westminster’s parliamentary e-petitions system,"Popular dissatisfaction with representative democracy has encouraged governments and legislatures worldwide to experiment with democratic innovations. However, despite calls for a ‘systemic’ approach to the study of democratic engagement and participation, empirical knowledge is limited about the diffusion of democratic innovations within civil society, and, in particular, about the connective mechanisms that bring the ‘voice’ of citizens to the ‘ears’ of political elites. This article responds to this gap, presenting original empirical research examining the UK House of Commons’ e-petitions system. This research maps public engagement with parliamentary e-petitions across a range of expressive spaces, and highlights the facilitative role of non-institutional intermediaries. However, it also underlines the predominant role of institutional actors in structuring public participation, and shows that effective transmission between the informal public and formal political spheres remains contingent on both ‘designed-in powers’ of institutional coupling and ‘developed practices’ of public engagement. Through this analysis, the article makes an important contribution to debates concerning democratic innovations, political participation, and institutional design. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION The online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1057/s41293-022-00208-9.","Popular dissatisfaction with established institutions of representative democracy has prompted a groundswell of interest in the restorative potential of ‘democratic innovations’ (Smith 2009); and governments and legislatures worldwide have experimented with an array of innovations intended to enable citizens to exercise voice (input) and influence policymaking (output). However, despite calls for a ‘systemic’ approach to the study of democratic engagement (Ercan et al. 2019; Hendriks 2016; Mansbridge et al. 2012), few studies have examined the diffusion of institutionally initiated democratic innovations within civil society, and the subsequent interplay between the informal public sphere of civil society and the formal public sphere of representative institutions (Habermas 1996). Specifically, whilst the necessity of ‘coupling’ to enable ‘convergence, mutual influence and mutual adjustment’ (Mansbridge et al. 2012, p. 23) between these spheres has been recognised, there is limited empirical knowledge about the facilitative mechanisms that bring the ‘voice’ of citizens to the ‘ears’ of policymakers (throughput) (exceptions including Boswell et al. 2016; Hendriks 2016). This gap matters because the success of democratic innovations requires citizens to regard them as efficacious (Fung 2015), rendering effective throughput mechanisms vital (Schmidt 2013). This article addresses this gap by appraising the formal and informal throughput mechanisms that bring to bear citizen input on the deliberations and decisions of political elites. It focuses on the parliamentary e-petition, a democratic innovation adopted by legislatures worldwide to promote greater engagement with parliament and provide additional opportunities for citizens to influence policymaking. The article presents original research on the UK House of Commons’ e-petitions system, widely regarded as one of the most successful innovations of its kind (Bochel 2019; Leston-Bandeira 2019). Specifically, this research examines the major inquiry by the Petitions Committee into the online abuse of disabled people (2017–2019), and subsequent inquiry into the wider issue of online harms (2020–2022). This research shows that public engagement with parliamentary e-petitions is not confined to the narrow act of petition signing, and occurs across a range of non-institutional or informal expressive spaces. However, whilst such engagement is intrinsically worthwhile and may contribute to several democratic goods, this research demonstrates the extent that subsequent action within the formal sphere of representative institutions is contingent on effective throughput mechanisms. Moreover, whilst drawing attention to the facilitative role of non-institutional intermediaries in terms of issue advocacy and support mobilisation, the research underscores the necessity of formal institutional linkages and highlights the integrative role of institutional gatekeepers—in this case the Petitions Committee—in terms of agenda setting; reaching out; and ‘coupling’ the informal and formal spheres."
PMC9128309,2022-05-24,Airborne transmission of the delta variant of SARS-CoV-2 in an auditorium,"The Delta variant of SARS-CoV-2 has inflicted heavy burdens on healthcare systems globally, although direct evidence on the quantity of exhaled viral shedding from Delta cases is lacking. Literature remains inconclusive on whether existing public health guidance, formulated based on earlier evidence of COVID-19, should respond differently to more infectious viral strains. This paper describes a study on an outbreak of the Delta variant of COVID-19 in an auditorium, where one person contracted the virus from three asymptomatic index cases sitting in a different row. Field inspections were conducted on the configuration of seating, building and ventilation systems. Numerical simulation was conducted to retrospectively assess the exhaled viral emission, decay, airborne dispersion, with a modified Wells-Riley equation used to calculate the inhalation exposure and disease infection risks at the seat level. Results support the airborne disease transmission. The viral emission rate for Delta cases was estimated at 31 quanta per hour, 30 times higher than those of the original variant. The high quantity of viral plume exhaled by delta cases can create a risky zone nearby, which, for a mixing ventilation system, cannot be easily mitigated by raising mixing rates or introducing fresh air supply. Such risks can be reduced by wearing an N95 respirator, less so for social distancing. A displacement ventilation system, through which the air is supplied at the floor and returned from the ceiling, can reduce risks compared with a mixing system. The study has implications for ventilation guidelines and hygiene practices in light of more infectious viral strains of COVID-19.","The COVID-19 pandemic is dominated by more infectious viral lineage, such as the Delta or Omicron variant. Both contain diverse mutations in the viral RNA compared with the ancestral lineage, allowing them to evade immune responses  and infect or even transmit via fully vaccinated persons . The Delta variant of COVID-19, in particular, has inflicted heavy burdens on health and healthcare systems globally. First discovered in late 2020, it has shorter incubation periods and can generate higher viral loading in respiratory tracts and a longer duration of viral shedding for infected persons , and for this reason, spreads faster in a susceptible population. A review of available disease transmission data by the World Health Organization (WHO) concluded that Delta is 40–60% more transmissible  than earlier strains of COVID-19. Its base reproduction number (R0), the number of new infections generated by each case, was estimated to be 5.08, much higher than 2.79 of the original strain . Delta can purportedly inflict severe illness for the unvaccinated population , resulting in exceedingly large numbers of global cases and hospitalizations. Its main route of transmission is by inhalation of aerosol containing the virus, which is exhaled by breathing, talking or singing. The risk of inhaling the viral aerosol is greater when an individual is close from an infected person, where the aerosol concentration is higher. Research gaps remained as more knowledge on COVID-19 emerge. On the one hand, the quantity of exhaled viral emission from Delta cases has not been estimated in scientific literature. On the other hand, literature remained inconclusive on whether public health guidance should respond differently towards more infectious viral variants in global circulation. Prevailing literature suggest that sufficient air ventilation, such as supplying clean outdoor air, or increasing the mixing of indoor air, should be prioritized in order to reduce the risk of disease transmission in an indoor space. In addition, hygiene measures such as mask wearing, social distancing, and body temperature-checking should be practiced in public buildings. These guidance above were largely formulated based on evidence of the ancestral lineages of COVID-19, their protective effects against new viral variants have not be sufficiently studied."
PMC9109084,2022-05-12,Modelling the potential spread of virus during soccer matches,"OBJECTIVE In the present study, we model the potential spread of virus during soccer matches. METHODS Tracking data from 14 elite soccer matches was used. One player in each match was designated as a virus carrier (called ‘infected player’) for the purpose of the study. The exposure score (measured in seconds) was calculated as time spent closer than 1.5 m from the infected player or time spent in an exponentially declining zone, where the infected player was positioned earlier. RESULTS The results revealed that, on average, each player was exposed for 87.8 s per match. CONCLUSION Potential spread of virus during soccer matches was modelled and it revealed that the exposure to a virus during soccer matches is limited.","Following spread of the SARS-CoV-2, most countries globally and the WHO have emphasised social distancing among the protective measures.1 This suggests that sports in which the athletes are in close contact should be avoided. Soccer is one of these sports. The SARS-CoV-2, as other viruses, is generally believed to spread through contact or indirectly through the air.2 The spread through contact occurs when particles from an infected person attach to a surface or an object, and other people then touch that surface or object before touching their own eyes, nose or mouth.3 The spread can also occur through direct contact.3 The spread through the air occur when an infected person exhales particles which are inhaled by other persons. Particles are exhaled when an infected person coughs, sneezes or through heavy breathing, talking or shouting.4 Although it is not clear how far the particles travel through the air or how long they last in the air, the general guideline regarding social distancing recommends that persons keep a distance of at least 1 m1 or 2 m5 from each other."

Our objective in this study is to evaluate the epidemiological features of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection and death in Fars province, Iran. METHODS A cross-sectional study was conducted from February 18(th) to September 30(th), 2020, where age, history of underlying diseases, sex, community-wide quarantine, nationality, close contact, pregnancy, medical staff job, traveling , and residency were compared between alive and deceased groups. Data were analyzed using IBM SPSS software, version 22.0, and the significance level was set at 0.05. RESULTS Regarding 57958 new cases of COVID-19, the basic reproduction number (R) was estimated as 2.8, requiring a minimum of 65% immunization to reach herd immunity. Moreover, an R=0.36 was required to reach the endemic state in the region. The incidence, mortality, fatality, and recurrence rates of COVID-19 were estimated as 1347.9 per 100,000 dwellers, 209.5 per 1000,000 dwellers, 1.6 %, and 3.1 per 100,000 dwellers, respectively. Age, history of underlying diseases, urban residency, and the male sex were significantly higher in the deceased group (OR=1.09, 5.48, 1.24, and 1.32; All Ps<0.001, <0.001, 0.005, and <0.001, respectively). In addition, the recurrence rate among positive cases was estimated as 0.23% with a median±inter-quartile range equal to 84±46.25 days. Community-wide quarantine was shown to be a protective factor for death due to COVID-19 (OR=0.58, P=0.005). CONCLUSION Community-wide quarantine blocks the transmission of COVID-19 effectively. COVID-19 enjoys no solid immunity. History of underlying diseases, the male sex, urban residency, and age were among the most significant causes of death due to COVID-19.

PMC9130600,2022-05-11,Neuroimmune Interaction: A Widespread Mutual Regulation and the Weapons for Barrier Organs,"Since the embryo, the nervous system and immune system have been interacting to regulate each other’s development and working together to resist harmful stimuli. However, oversensitive neural response and uncontrolled immune attack are major causes of various diseases, especially in barrier organs, while neural-immune interaction makes it worse. As the first defense line, the barrier organs give a guarantee to maintain homeostasis in external environment. And the dense nerve innervation and abundant immune cell population in barrier organs facilitate the neuroimmune interaction, which is the physiological basis of multiple neuroimmune-related diseases. Neuroimmune-related diseases often have complex mechanisms and require a combination of drugs, posing challenges in finding etiology and treatment. Therefore, it is of great significance to illustrate the specific mechanism and exact way of neuro-immune interaction. In this review, we first described the mutual regulation of the two principal systems and then focused on neuro-immune interaction in the barrier organs, including intestinal tract, lungs and skin, to clarify the mechanisms and provide ideas for clinical etiology exploration and treatment.","Adapting to environmental changes and maintaining homeostasis requires the involvement of both the nervous system and immune system (Veiga-Fernandes and Pachnis, 2017; Zhang et al., 2021). The nervous system dominates tissues or organs mainly through a variety of neurotransmitters, while the immune system resists pathogens by phagocytosis and immune-active substances. According to research in recent years, the two systems can be linked together as a whole through certain agents, such as neurotransmitters, cytokines, hormones, etc (Chavan et al., 2017; Reardon et al., 2018). Neurotransmitter receptors are distributed on some immune cells, which are the foundation of neuromodulation of the immune system. And there are also cytokine receptors on nerve endings, which are the essential pathway for immunomodulation of the nervous system. The nervous system speeds up the immune response, and the immune system correspondingly helps transfer information to the nervous system. Neuro-immune interaction enriches the body’s response to the environment. However, under certain circumstances, neuro-immune interactions are the driving factors for the onset and progression of numerous diseases (Kabata and Artis, 2019; Tanaka and Okusa, 2019; Scheiblich et al., 2020). For the past few years, there is increasing evidence about the mutual regulation of nerve and immune systems, which reveals that nerves regulate the generation, maturation, and release of immune cells (Elenkov et al., 2000), and immunity is involved in neural development (Cowan and Petri, 2018; Vainchtein et al., 2018). As the first line of defense, the gut-skin-lung barrier plays an important role in clearing harmful substances, resisting pathogen invasion, and maintaining homeostasis, and its dysfunction leads to the occurrence and progression of diseases. What’s more, there are dense nerve innervation and resident immune cell groups on the barrier, and the neuro-immune interaction occupies a more significant position in the pathogenesis of diseases. For example, neuropeptides secreted by sensory nerves trigger neurogenic inflammation and lead to allergic diseases (Sousa-Valente and Brain, 2018), while sympathetic and parasympathetic nerves produce neurotransmitters binding to different receptors on immune cells for immune regulation (Kenney and Ganta, 2014). Cytokine receptors on nerve endings collect information of immune status and transmit feedback signs."
PMC9130760,2021-12-23,"Likely community transmission of COVID-19 infections between neighboring, persistent hotspots in Ontario, Canada","Introduction This study aimed to produce community-level geo-spatial mapping of confirmed COVID-19 cases in Ontario Canada in near real-time to support decision-making. This was accomplished by area-to-area geostatistical analysis, space-time integration, and spatial interpolation of COVID-19 positive individuals. Methods COVID-19 cases and locations were curated for geostatistical analyses from March 2020 through June 2021, corresponding to the first, second, and third waves of infections. Daily cases were aggregated according to designated forward sortation area (FSA), and postal codes (PC) in municipal regions Hamilton, Kitchener/Waterloo, London, Ottawa, Toronto, and Windsor/Essex county. Hotspots were identified with area-to-area tests including Getis-Ord Gi*, Global Moran’s I spatial autocorrelation, and Local Moran’s I asymmetric clustering and outlier analyses. Case counts were also interpolated across geographic regions by Empirical Bayesian Kriging, which localizes high concentrations of COVID-19 positive tests, independent of FSA or PC boundaries. The Geostatistical Disease Epidemiology Toolbox, which is freely-available software, automates the identification of these regions and produces digital maps for public health professionals to assist in pandemic management of contact tracing and distribution of other resources. Results This study provided indicators in real-time of likely, community-level disease transmission through innovative geospatial analyses of COVID-19 incidence data. Municipal and provincial results were validated by comparisons with known outbreaks at long-term care and other high density residences and on farms. PC-level analyses revealed hotspots at higher geospatial resolution than public reports of FSAs, and often sooner. Results of different tests and kriging were compared to determine consistency among hotspot assignments. Concurrent or consecutive hotspots in close proximity suggested potential community transmission of COVID-19 from cluster and outlier analysis of neighboring PCs and by kriging. Results were also stratified by population based-categories (sex, age, and presence/absence of comorbidities). Conclusions Earlier recognition of hotspots could reduce public health burdens of COVID-19 and expedite contact tracing.","Many critical elements of disease epidemiology were unknown during the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic. This included the case fatality rate, at what point during the natural history of the disease was it most transmissible (before, during or after the onset of symptoms), the frequencies of asymptomatic presentation of positive cases, and the duration of infectivity.1
 Quarantining, social distancing, and isolation of infected populations were quickly recognized as effective public health measures. Without implementation of these measures in Ontario, COVID-19 patients presenting with severe disease would have exceeded available hospital capacity.2
 Delayed testing and the sheer numbers of infected individuals often precluded comprehensive contact tracing.3
 Indeed, COVID-19 testing was limited in many regions within Canada early in the pandemic, as was the availability of necessary resources (e.g., intensive care units, nursing and other clinical personnel, personal protective equipment).4,5
 Limited resources must be adequately allocated to those locations where the rates of transmission of COVID-19 are high and where the highest numbers of infected individuals reside. This highlights the need for an effective, systematic way of tracking concentrations of this disease after community-level transmission. We address the persistence of geographic disease hotspots as a potential sentinel for efficient distribution of sparse resources. The SARS-CoV-2 virus spreads by person-to-person contact, especially through respiration.6
 Geographic epidemiology can be a key factor for the prevention of disease spread, as it can be used to monitor disease progression (or regression) and manage allocation of medical resources. Geostatistical methods have been utilized to map communicable diseases such as influenza-like diseases,7
 dengue fever,8
 cholera,9
 legionellosis and shigellosis, among others.10
 Various geostatistical analyses have been used in the surveillance of COVID-19 spread across the globe,11–17
 often with the geo-spatial software, ArcGIS (ESRI).18
 Other available tools for geostatistical epidemiology include SaTScan
TM,19
 GeoDa,20
 and R statistical software environment,21
 however these were not used in the present study because of their requirement to input disease background levels, which was not relevant for COVID-19. Available case data analyzed has been typically aggregated at the municipal11,16
 or county level,13,14,22
 however higher resolution spatial analyses has been limited as finer granularity for the distribution of COVID-19 cases has often been lacking.16,18
 We performed geostatistical area-to-area analyses as well as interpolation of COVID-19 cases within six municipalities of the Canadian province of Ontario (Hamilton, Kitchener/Waterloo, London, Ottawa, Toronto and Windsor/Essex region) distributed at the level of individual forward sortation areas (FSA) and postal codes (PCs). Area-to-area analyses were performed on COVID-19 case data at the provincial level by FSA, a geographical unit which can encompass hundreds of PCs. Each PC comprises an average of 19 households (Statistics Canada, 2006)."
PMC9133617,2022-05-26,Complex dynamics and control analysis of an epidemic model with non-monotone incidence and saturated treatment,"In this manuscript, we consider an epidemic model having constant recruitment of susceptible individuals with non-monotone disease transmission rate and saturated-type treatment rate. Two types of disease control strategies are taken here, namely vaccination for susceptible individuals and treatment for infected individuals to minimize the impact of the disease. We study local as well as global stability analysis of the disease-free equilibrium point and also endemic equilibrium point based on the values of basic reproduction number [Formula see text] . Therefore, disease eradicates from the population if basic reproduction number less than unity and disease persists in the population if basic reproduction number greater than unity. We use center manifold theorem to study the dynamical behavior of the disease-free equilibrium point for [Formula see text] . We investigate different bifurcations such as transcritical bifurcation, backward bifurcation, saddle-node bifurcation, Hopf bifurcation and Bogdanov–Takens bifurcation of co-dimension 2. The biological significance of all types of bifurcations are described. Some numerical simulations are performed to check the reliability of our theoretical approach. Sensitivity analysis is performed to identify the influential model parameters which have most impact on the basic reproduction number of the proposed model. To control or eradicate the influence of the emerging disease, we need to control the most sensitive model parameters using necessary preventive measures. We study optimal control problem using Pontryagin’s maximum principle. Finally using efficiency analysis, we determine most effective control strategy among applied controls.","Epidemiology is a part of mathematical biology which mainly associates with the study of infectious and vector-borne disease and its control strategies in a human population. To study the influence and effect of the communicable disease, researchers often used mathematical models which lead a significant role in theory of epidemiology [1, 2]. Mathematical models are used to provide understanding the dynamical behavior of the disease and to improve plans for eradicating the infection. In epidemiology, first known mathematical model is invented and worked by Daniel Bernoulli . In the middle of twentieth century, mathematical epidemiology strode widely around the world [4–6]. The father of modern mathematical epidemiology, Ronald Ross, derived a threshold quantity, called as basic reproduction number, which helps the planners to conclude when the infection will eliminate. In 1927, Kermack and McKendrick wielded mathematical epidemiology to a new level by his contribution for infectious disease . Later on, researchers formulate various mathematical models for developing strategies to control disease outbreak and making a trade-offs in choosing a best possible treatment for seizing the infection [8–10]. In mathematical modeling, recruitment rate of susceptible population, incidence rate of disease transmission and recovery rate have been playing a crucial role in deterministic approach of mathematical epidemiology. Mainly two types of recruitment rates are considered to formulate mathematical models. Constant birth rate has been taken into consideration for discussing compartmental model by the authors in [11, 12], which is not realistic in many certain cases. Under this circumstances, logistic growth rate of susceptible has been used to make mathematical models more realistic in case of limited resources and space capacities, disease with long lasting disease [13, 14]."
PMC9137965,2022-05-13,Mathematical COVID-19 model with vaccination: a case study in Saudi Arabia,"The discovery of a new form of corona-viruses in December 2019, SARS-CoV-2, commonly named COVID-19, has reshaped the world. With health and economic issues at stake, scientists have been focusing on understanding the dynamics of the disease, in order to provide the governments with the best policies and strategies allowing them to reduce the span of the virus. The world has been waiting for the vaccine for more than one year. The World Health Organization (WHO) is advertising the vaccine as a safe and effective measure to fight off the virus. Saudi Arabia was the fourth country in the world to start to vaccinate its population. Even with the new simplified COVID-19 rules, the third dose is still mandatory. COVID-19 vaccines have raised many questions regarding in its efficiency and its role to reduce the number of infections. In this work, we try to answer these question and propose a new mathematical model with five compartments, including susceptible, vaccinated, infectious, asymptotic and recovered individuals. We provide theoretical results regarding the effective reproduction number, the stability of endemic equilibrium and disease free equilibrium. We provide numerical analysis of the model based on the Saudi case. Our developed model shows that the vaccine reduces the transmission rate and provides an explanation to the rise in the number of new infections immediately after the start of the vaccination campaign in Saudi Arabia.","The outbreak of several pandemics such as COVID-19 requires the development of mathematical models in order to exhibit key epidemiological features, investigate transmission dynamics, and develop adequate control policies. Mathematical modelling when dealing with infectious diseases allows revealing inherent patterns and underlying structures that govern outbreaks. Simple models that contain the essential components and interactions are powerful tools to test different hypotheses and understand disease control for both short and long time. The stability analysis near the free disease equilibrium will show if the apparition of new infection cases will yield to disease outbreak. Some countries such Tunisia and Jordan registered zero cases for days in Summer 2020 but the introduction of new cases resulted in critical endemic situation by Autumn. The complex spreading patterns of COVID-19 and the various spread speed of its variants make its containing and mitigating real challenges. The existing models vary in form and complexity, but the common objective is to provide important information for global health decision makers about the disease dynamics. The first control measure was lockdown and then health authorities imposed mask wearing and social distancing. Khajanchi et al.  showed, by extending the classical SEIR model, that social distance is an important factor to reduce the reproduction number and this to reduce the virus spread. Despite the herd immunity acquired via vaccine or infection, the social distancing is still recommended as a public health measure. Driven by the observed characteristics of COVID-19, we propose a mathematical model with two infectious states. It was reported by World Health Organization that one in three people who get COVID-19 do not show any symptoms. This is a challenging problem for health authorities as the asymptotic individuals carry the virus and may infect other people without knowing it. Moreover, consequent efforts were made worldwide since the authorisation of new vaccines by the end of 2020. By the end of November 2021, more than 50% of the world population has first dose administered and only 40% has second dose administered. In order to study the efficacy of vaccination to contain the virus spread and its negative consequences, our model include vaccinated state. The objective is to provide efficient public health policies in determining optimal vaccination strategies. Some questions have raised since the beginning of vaccination campaigns how many individuals should be vaccinated? Is the vaccine a solution to get rid of the disease permanently? These questions are related to financial and moral costs associated with the chosen governmental policy. This paper gives theoretical and numerical analysis associated with COVID-19 epidemic dynamics in order to answer these critical questions. Although we focus mainly on the Saudi case, the model structure is general and numerically adapted to any specific context without loss of validity of the qualitative results here shown. The main contributions of this research are given as follows"
